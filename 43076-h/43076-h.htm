<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY_NOTE" id="INTRODUCTORY_NOTE">INTRODUCTORY NOTE</a></h2>

<p>In the summer of 1859, Mrs. Stowe made her third and
last journey to Europe. During the summer, the whole
family was abroad, save the youngest; but in the autumn
Mr. Stowe and one of the daughters returned to America,
leaving Mrs. Stowe with two daughters and a son to spend
the winter in Italy. The residence there was mainly to
establish the health of the family; but Mrs. Stowe had
entered into engagements with the New York <i class="pub">Ledger</i> and
the New York <i class="pub">Independent</i> to furnish contributions, with
a design ultimately of collecting the papers and recasting
them for a volume to be published in the spring of 1860
in America and England, under the title of <i class="pub">Leaves from
Foreign Books for Home Reading</i>. She had indeed entered
into an agreement with Sampson Low &amp; Co., the London
publishers of <i class="pub">Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> and <i class="pub">Dred</i>, for the publication
of the volume, but a sudden change of plans brought
her home before she had perfected her book, and it was
never published.</p>

<p>Meanwhile her dramatic instinct had begun to work upon
the material thus gathered. It was impossible for her, with
her strong religious nature and her active interest in structural
Christianity to avoid subjecting the great church so
constantly in evidence to those tests of personal religion
which had been familiar to her from childhood. Her stay
in Florence brought vividly before her the figure of Savonarola,
and her imagination, in seeking to recover the life of
his day, instinctively invested it with the spiritual struggles
so well known to her and her circle. There was no conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
protestantizing of the life, as one may say, but the
story which she told naturally reflected the color of her own
religious training. <i class="pub">Agnes of Sorrento</i> was begun in this
Italian winter, and had its immediate origin, as she herself
explains in the following note, in a friendly contest of story
telling. It was not completed until some time after the
return to America, finding its first publication in <i class="pub">The Atlantic
Monthly</i> in America and <i class="pub">The Cornhill Magazine</i> in
England. In <i class="pub">The Atlantic</i> it was begun in May, 1861,
and finished in April, 1862.</p>

<p>In the party with Mrs. Stowe were Mr. and Mrs. Howard
of Brooklyn, and their children. When the tale made
its final appearance in book form, it was accompanied by
the following passages from a letter to the publishers by
Mrs. Stowe. The "Annie" referred to was Miss Annie
Howard.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The author was spending some weeks with a party of
choice and very dear friends, on an excursion to southern
Italy. Nothing could have been more fabulously and dreamily
bright and beautiful than the whole time thus employed.
Naples, Sorrento, Salerno, Pæstum, Pompeii, are names of
enchantment which will never fade from the remembrance
of any of that party. At Salerno, within a day's ride of
Pæstum, the whole company were detained by a storm for
a day and a night. The talents of the whole company were
called in requisition to make the gloomy evening pass pleasantly
with song and jest and story. The first chapters of
this story were there written and read, to the accompanying
dash of the Mediterranean. The plan of the whole future
history was then sketched out. Whether it ever find much
favor in the eyes of the world or not, sure it is, the story
was a child of love in its infancy, and its flowery Italian
cradle rocked it with an indulgent welcome.</p>

<p>"The writer and the party were fresh from strolls and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
rambles about charming Sorrento; they had explored the
gloomy gorge, and carried away golden boughs of fruits and
blossoms from her orange orchards. Under the shadow of
the old arched gateway they had seen, sitting at her orange
stand, a beautiful young girl, whose name became Agnes in
the story; and in the shadows of the gorge they met that
woman straight and tall, with silver hair, Roman nose, and
dark eyes, whose name became Elsie. The whole golden
scene receded centuries back, and they saw them in a vision
as they might and must have been in other days.</p>

<p>"The author begs to say that this story is a mere dreamland,
that it neither assumes nor will have responsibility
for historical accuracy. It merely reproduces to the reader
the visionary region that appeared to the writer; and if
some critic says this date be wrong, or that incident out of
place, let us answer, 'Who criticises perspective and distances,
that looks down into a purple lake at eventide? All
dates shall give way to the fortunes of our story, and our
lovers shall have the benefit of fairy-land; and whoso wants
history will not find it here, except to our making, and as
it suits our purpose.'</p>

<p>"The story is dedicated to the dear friends, wherever
scattered, who first listened to it at Salerno. Alas! in
writing this, a sorrow falls upon us,&mdash;the brightest, in
youth and beauty, and in promise of happy life, who listened
to that beginning, has passed to the land of silence.</p>

<p>"When our merry company left Sorrento, all the younger
members adorned themselves with profuse knots of roses,
which grew there so abundantly that it would seem no
plucking could exhaust them. A beautiful girl sat opposite
the writer in the carriage and said, 'Now I will count
my roses; I have just seven knots, and in each seven roses.'
And in reply, another remarked, 'Seven is the perfect
number, and seven times seven is perfection.' 'It is no
emblem,' she said gayly, 'of what a perfect time of enjoyment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
we have had.' One month later, and this rose had
faded and passed away.</p>

<p>"There be many who will understand and tenderly feel
the meaning, when we say that this little history is dedicated
to the memory of <span class="smcap">Annie</span>."</p></blockquote>

<span class="smaller">THE OLD TOWN</span></h2>

<p>The setting sunbeams slant over the antique gateway of
Sorrento, fusing into a golden bronze the brown freestone
vestments of old Saint Antonio, who with his heavy stone
mitre and upraised hands has for centuries kept watch
thereupon.</p>

<p>A quiet time he has of it up there in the golden Italian
air, in petrified act of blessing, while orange lichens and
green mosses from year to year embroider quaint patterns
on the seams of his sacerdotal vestments, and small tassels
of grass volunteer to ornament the folds of his priestly
drapery, and golden showers of blossoms from some more
hardy plant fall from his ample sleeve-cuffs. Little birds
perch and chitter and wipe their beaks unconcernedly, now
on the tip of his nose and now on the point of his mitre,
while the world below goes on its way pretty much as it
did when the good saint was alive, and, in despair of the
human brotherhood, took to preaching to the birds and
the fishes.</p>

<p>Whoever passed beneath this old arched gateway, thus
saint-guarded, in the year of our Lord's grace &mdash;&mdash;, might
have seen under its shadow, sitting opposite to a stand of
golden oranges, the little Agnes.</p>

<p>A very pretty picture was she, reader,&mdash;with such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
face as you sometimes see painted in those wayside shrines
of sunny Italy, where the lamp burns pale at evening, and
gillyflower and cyclamen are renewed with every morning.</p>

<p>She might have been fifteen or thereabouts, but was so
small of stature that she seemed yet a child. Her black
hair was parted in a white unbroken seam down to the high
forehead, whose serious arch, like that of a cathedral door,
spoke of thought and prayer. Beneath the shadows of this
brow lay brown, translucent eyes, into whose thoughtful
depths one might look as pilgrims gaze into the waters of
some saintly well, cool and pure down to the unblemished
sand at the bottom. The small lips had a gentle compression,
which indicated a repressed strength of feeling; while
the straight line of the nose, and the flexible, delicate nostril,
were perfect as in those sculptured fragments of the
antique which the soil of Italy so often gives forth to the
day from the sepulchres of the past. The habitual pose of
the head and face had the shy uplooking grace of a violet;
and yet there was a grave tranquillity of expression, which
gave a peculiar degree of character to the whole figure.</p>

<p>At the moment at which we have called your attention,
the fair head is bent, the long eyelashes lie softly down on
the pale, smooth cheek; for the Ave Maria bell is sounding
from the Cathedral of Sorrento, and the child is busy with
her beads.</p>

<p>By her side sits a woman of some threescore years, tall,
stately, and squarely formed, with ample breadth of back
and size of chest, like the robust dames of Sorrento. Her
strong Roman nose, the firm, determined outline of her
mouth, and a certain energy in every motion, speak the
woman of will and purpose. There is a degree of vigor in
the decision with which she lays down her spindle and
bows her head, as a good Christian of those days would,
at the swinging of the evening bell.</p>

<p>But while the soul of the child in its morning freshness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
free from pressure or conscience of earthly care, rose like
an illuminated mist to heaven, the words the white-haired
woman repeated were twined with threads of worldly prudence,&mdash;thoughts
of how many oranges she had sold, with
a rough guess at the probable amount for the day,&mdash;and
her fingers wandered from her beads a moment to see if
the last coin had been swept from the stand into her capacious
pocket, and her eyes wandering after them suddenly
made her aware of the fact that a handsome cavalier was
standing in the gate, regarding her pretty grandchild with
looks of undisguised admiration.</p>

<p>"Let him look!" she said to herself, with a grim clasp
on her rosary; "a fair face draws buyers, and our oranges
must be turned into money; but he who does more than
look has an affair with me; so gaze away, my master,
and take it out in buying oranges!&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ave Maria! ora pro
nobis, nunc et</i>," etc., etc.</p>

<p>A few moments, and the wave of prayer which had
flowed down the quaint old shadowy street, bowing all
heads as the wind bowed the scarlet tassels of neighboring
clover-fields, was passed, and all the world resumed the
work of earth just where they left off when the bell began.</p>

<p>"Good even to you, pretty maiden!" said the cavalier,
approaching the stall of the orange-woman with the easy,
confident air of one secure of a ready welcome, and bending
down on the yet prayerful maiden the glances of a pair of
piercing hazel eyes that looked out on each side of his
aquiline nose with the keenness of a falcon's.</p>

<p>"Good even to you, pretty one! We shall take you for
a saint, and worship you in right earnest, if you raise not
those eyelashes soon."</p>

<p>"Sir! my lord!" said the girl,&mdash;a bright color flushing
into her smooth brown cheeks, and her large dreamy eyes
suddenly upraised with a flutter, as of a bird about to take
flight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
"Agnes, bethink yourself!" said the white-haired dame;
"the gentleman asks the price of your oranges; be alive,
child!"</p>

<p>"Ah, my lord," said the young girl, "here are a dozen
fine ones."</p>

<p>"Well, you shall give them me, pretty one," said the
young man, throwing a gold piece down on the stand with
a careless ring.</p>

<p>"Here, Agnes, run to the stall of Raphael the poulterer
for change," said the adroit dame, picking up the gold.</p>

<p>"Nay, good mother, by your leave," said the unabashed
cavalier; "I make my change with youth and beauty
thus!" And with the word he stooped down and kissed
the fair forehead between the eyes.</p>

<p>"For shame, sir!" said the elderly woman, raising her
distaff,&mdash;her great glittering eyes flashing beneath her
silver hair like tongues of lightning from a white cloud.
"Have a care!&mdash;this child is named for blessed Saint
Agnes, and is under her protection."</p>

<p>"The saints must pray for us, when their beauty makes
us forget ourselves," said the young cavalier, with a smile.
"Look me in the face, little one," he added; "say, wilt
thou pray for me?"</p>

<p>The maiden raised her large serious eyes, and surveyed
the haughty, handsome face with that look of sober inquiry
which one sometimes sees in young children, and the
blush slowly faded from her cheek, as a cloud fades after
sunset.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord," she answered, with a grave simplicity,
"I will pray for you."</p>

<p>"And hang this upon the shrine of Saint Agnes for my
sake," he added, drawing from his finger a diamond ring,
which he dropped into her hand; and before mother or
daughter could add another word or recover from their surprise,
he had thrown the corner of his mantle over his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
shoulder and was off down the narrow street, humming the
refrain of a gay song.</p>

<p>"You have struck a pretty dove with that bolt," said
another cavalier, who appeared to have been observing the
proceeding, and now, stepping forward, joined him.</p>

<p>"Like enough," said the first, carelessly.</p>

<p>"The old woman keeps her mewed up like a singing-bird,"
said the second; "and if a fellow wants speech of
her, it's as much as his crown is worth; for Dame Elsie
has a strong arm, and her distaff is known to be heavy."</p>

<p>"Upon my word," said the first cavalier, stopping and
throwing a glance backward, "where do they keep her?"</p>

<p>"Oh, in a sort of pigeon's nest up above the Gorge; but
one never sees her, except under the fire of her grandmother's
eyes. The little one is brought up for a saint, they
say, and goes nowhere but to mass, confession, and the
sacrament."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the other, "she looks like some choice
old picture of Our Lady,&mdash;not a drop of human blood in
her. When I kissed her forehead, she looked into my face
as grave and innocent as a babe. One is tempted to try
what one can do in such a case."</p>

<p>"Beware the grandmother's distaff!" said the other,
laughing.</p>

<p>"I've seen old women before," said the cavalier, as
they turned down the street and were lost to view.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the grandmother and grand-daughter were
roused from the mute astonishment in which they were
gazing after the young cavalier by a tittering behind them;
and a pair of bright eyes looked out upon them from beneath
a bundle of long, crimson-headed clover, whose rich
carmine tints were touched to brighter life by setting sunbeams.</p>

<p>There stood Giulietta, the head coquette of the Sorrento
girls, with her broad shoulders, full chest, and great black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
eyes, rich and heavy as those of the silver-haired ox for
whose benefit she had been cutting clover. Her bronzed
cheek was smooth as that of any statue, and showed a color
like that of an open pomegranate; and the opulent, lazy
abundance of her ample form, with her leisurely movements,
spoke an easy and comfortable nature,&mdash;that is to say,
when Giulietta was pleased; for it is to be remarked that
there lurked certain sparkles deep down in her great eyes,
which might, on occasion, blaze out into sheet-lightning,
like her own beautiful skies, which, lovely as they are, can
thunder and sulk with terrible earnestness when the fit
takes them. At present, however, her face was running
over with mischievous merriment, as she slyly pinched little
Agnes by the ear.</p>

<p>"So you know not yon gay cavalier, little sister?" she
said, looking askance at her from under her long lashes.</p>

<p>"No, indeed! What has an honest girl to do with
knowing gay cavaliers?" said Dame Elsie, bestirring herself
with packing the remaining oranges into a basket,
which she covered trimly with a heavy linen towel of her
own weaving. "Girls never come to good who let their
eyes go walking through the earth, and have the names of
all the wild gallants on their tongues. Agnes knows no
such nonsense,&mdash;blessed be her gracious patroness, with
Our Lady and Saint Michael!"</p>

<p>"I hope there is no harm in knowing what is right before
one's eyes," said Giulietta. "Anybody must be blind
and deaf not to know the Lord Adrian. All the girls in
Sorrento know him. They say he is even greater than he
appears,&mdash;that he is brother to the King himself; at any
rate, a handsomer and more gallant gentleman never wore
spurs."</p>

<p>"Let him keep to his own kind," said Elsie. "Eagles
make bad work in dove-cots. No good comes of such gallants
for us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
"Nor any harm, that I ever heard of," said Giulietta.
"But let me see, pretty one,&mdash;what did he give you?
Holy Mother! what a handsome ring!"</p>

<p>"It is to hang on the shrine of Saint Agnes," said the
younger girl, looking up with simplicity.</p>

<p>A loud laugh was the first answer to this communication.
The scarlet clover-tops shook and quivered with the
merriment.</p>

<p>"To hang on the shrine of Saint Agnes!" Giulietta repeated.
"That is a little too good!"</p>

<p>"Go, go, you baggage!" said Elsie, wrathfully brandishing
her spindle. "If ever you get a husband, I hope he'll
give you a good beating! You need it, I warrant! Always
stopping on the bridge there, to have cracks with the
young men! Little enough you know of saints, I dare
say! So keep away from <i>my</i> child! Come, Agnes," she
said, as she lifted the orange-basket on to her head; and,
straightening her tall form, she seized the girl by the hand
to lead her away.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE DOVE-COT</span></h2>

<p>The old town of Sorrento is situated on an elevated plateau,
which stretches into the sunny waters of the Mediterranean,
guarded on all sides by a barrier of mountains
which defend it from bleak winds and serve to it the purpose
of walls to a garden. Here, groves of oranges and
lemons, with their almost fabulous coincidence of fruitage
with flowers, fill the air with perfume, which blends with
that of roses and jessamines; and the fields are so starred
and enameled with flowers that they might have served as
the type for those Elysian realms sung by ancient poets.
The fervid air is fanned by continual sea-breezes, which
give a delightful elasticity to the otherwise languid climate.
Under all these cherishing influences, the human
being develops a wealth and luxuriance of physical beauty
unknown in less favored regions. In the region about
Sorrento one may be said to have found the land where
beauty is the rule and not the exception. The singularity
there is not to see handsome points of physical proportion,
but rather to see those who are without them. Scarce a
man, woman, or child you meet who has not some personal
advantage to be commended, while even striking beauty is
common. Also, under these kindly skies, a native courtesy
and gentleness of manner make themselves felt. It
would seem as if humanity, rocked in this flowery cradle,
and soothed by so many daily caresses and appliances of
nursing Nature, grew up with all that is kindliest on the
outward,&mdash;not repressed and beat in, as under the inclement
atmosphere and stormy skies of the North.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
The town of Sorrento itself overhangs the sea, skirting
along rocky shores, which, hollowed here and there into
picturesque grottoes, and fledged with a wild plumage of
brilliant flowers and trailing vines, descend in steep precipices
to the water. Along the shelly beach, at the bottom,
one can wander to look out on the loveliest prospect in the
world. Vesuvius rises with its two peaks softly clouded
in blue and purple mists, which blend with its ascending
vapors,&mdash;Naples and the adjoining villages at its base
gleaming in the distance like a fringe of pearls on a regal
mantle. Nearer by, the picturesque rocky shores of the
island of Capri seem to pulsate through the dreamy, shifting
mists that veil its sides; and the sea shimmers and
glitters like the neck of a peacock with an iridescent mingling
of colors: the whole air is a glorifying medium, rich
in prismatic hues of enchantment.</p>

<p>The town on three sides is severed from the main land
by a gorge two hundred feet in depth and forty or fifty in
breadth, crossed by a bridge resting on double arches, the
construction of which dates back to the time of the ancient
Romans. This bridge affords a favorite lounging-place for
the inhabitants, and at evening a motley assemblage may
be seen lolling over its moss-grown sides,&mdash;men with their
picturesque knit caps of scarlet or brown falling gracefully
on one shoulder, and women with their shining black hair
and the enormous pearl ear-rings which are the pride and
heirlooms of every family. The present traveler at Sorrento
may remember standing on this bridge and looking
down the gloomy depths of the gorge, to where a fair villa,
with its groves of orange-trees and gardens, overhangs the
tremendous depths below.</p>

<p>Hundreds of years since, where this villa now stands
was the simple dwelling of the two women whose history
we have begun to tell you. There you might have seen a
small stone cottage with a two-arched arcade in front,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
gleaming brilliantly white out of the dusky foliage of an
orange-orchard. The dwelling was wedged like a bird-box
between two fragments of rock, and behind it the land
rose rocky, high, and steep, so as to form a natural wall.
A small ledge or terrace of cultivated land here hung in
air,&mdash;below it, a precipice of two hundred feet down into
the Gorge of Sorrento. A couple of dozen orange-trees,
straight and tall, with healthy, shining bark, here shot up
from the fine black volcanic soil, and made with their foliage
a twilight shadow on the ground, so deep that no vegetation,
save a fine velvet moss, could dispute their claim to
its entire nutritious offices. These trees were the sole
wealth of the women and the sole ornament of the garden;
but, as they stood there, not only laden with golden fruit,
but fragrant with pearly blossoms, they made the little
rocky platform seem a perfect Garden of the Hesperides.
The stone cottage, as we have said, had an open, whitewashed
arcade in front, from which one could look down
into the gloomy depths of the gorge, as into some mysterious
underworld. Strange and weird it seemed, with its
fathomless shadows and its wild grottoes, over which hung,
silently waving, long pendants of ivy, while dusky gray
aloes uplifted their horned heads from great rock-rifts, like
elfin spirits struggling upward out of the shade. Nor was
wanting the usual gentle poetry of flowers; for white iris
leaned its fairy pavilion over the black void like a pale-cheeked
princess from the window of some dark enchanted
castle, and scarlet geranium and golden broom and crimson
gladiolus waved and glowed in the shifting beams of the
sunlight. Also there was in this little spot what forms the
charm of Italian gardens always,&mdash;the sweet song and
prattle of waters. A clear mountain-spring burst through
the rock on one side of the little cottage, and fell with a
lulling noise into a quaint moss-grown water-trough, which
had been in former times the sarcophagus of some old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Roman sepulchre. Its sides were richly sculptured with
figures and leafy scrolls and arabesques, into which the
sly-footed lichens with quiet growth had so insinuated
themselves as in some places almost to obliterate the original
design; while, round the place where the water fell,
a veil of ferns and maiden's-hair, studded with tremulous
silver drops, vibrated to its soothing murmur. The superfluous
waters, drained off by a little channel on one side,
were conducted through the rocky parapet of the garden,
whence they trickled and tinkled from rock to rock, falling
with a continual drip among the swaying ferns and pendent
ivy wreaths, till they reached the little stream at the bottom
of the gorge. This parapet or garden-wall was formed
of blocks or fragments of what had once been white marble,
the probable remains of the ancient tomb from which the
sarcophagus was taken. Here and there a marble acanthus-leaf,
or the capital of an old column, or a fragment of sculpture
jutted from under the mosses, ferns, and grasses with
which prodigal Nature had filled every interstice and carpeted
the whole. These sculptured fragments everywhere
in Italy seem to whisper, from the dust, of past life and
death, of a cycle of human existence forever gone, over
whose tomb the life of to-day is built.</p>

<p>"Sit down and rest, my dove," said Dame Elsie to her
little charge, as they entered their little enclosure.</p>

<p>Here she saw for the first time, what she had not noticed
in the heat and hurry of her ascent, that the girl was panting
and her gentle bosom rising and falling in thick heartbeats,
occasioned by the haste with which she had drawn
her onward.</p>

<p>"Sit down, dearie, and I will get you a bit of supper."</p>

<p>"Yes, grandmother, I will. I must tell my beads once
for the soul of the handsome gentleman that kissed my
forehead to-night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
"How did you know that he was handsome, child?"
said the old dame, with some sharpness in her voice.</p>

<p>"He bade me look on him, grandmother, and I saw it."</p>

<p>"You must put such thoughts away, child," said the old
dame.</p>

<p>"Why must I?" said the girl, looking up with an eye
as clear and unconscious as that of a three-year-old child.</p>

<p>"If she does not think, why should I tell her?" said
Dame Elsie, as she turned to go into the house, and left
the child sitting on the mossy parapet that overlooked the
gorge. Thence she could see far off, not only down the
dim, sombre abyss, but out to the blue Mediterranean beyond,
now calmly lying in swathing-bands of purple, gold,
and orange, while the smoky cloud that overhung Vesuvius
became silver and rose in the evening light.</p>

<p>There is always something of elevation and purity that
seems to come over one from being in an elevated region.
One feels morally as well as physically above the world,
and from that clearer air able to look down on it calmly
with disengaged freedom. Our little maiden sat for a few
moments gazing, her large brown eyes dilating with a
tremulous lustre, as if tears were half of a mind to start in
them, and her lips apart with a delicate earnestness, like
one who is pursuing some pleasing inner thought. Suddenly
rousing herself, she began by breaking the freshest
orange-blossoms from the golden-fruited trees, and, kissing
and pressing them to her bosom, she proceeded to remove
the faded flowers of the morning from before a little rude
shrine in the rock, where, in a sculptured niche, was a
picture of the Madonna and Child, with a locked glass door
in front of it. The picture was a happy transcript of one
of the fairest creations of the religious school of Florence,
done by one of those rustic copyists of whom Italy is full,
who appear to possess the instinct of painting, and to
whom we owe many of those sweet faces which sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
look down on us by the wayside from rudest and homeliest
shrines.</p>

<p>The poor fellow by whom it had been painted was one
to whom years before Dame Elsie had given food and shelter
for many months during a lingering illness; and he had
painted so much of his dying heart and hopes into it that
it had a peculiar and vital vividness in its power of affecting
the feelings. Agnes had been familiar with this picture
from early infancy. No day of her life had the flowers
failed to be freshly placed before it. It had seemed to
smile down sympathy on her childish joys, and to cloud
over with her childish sorrows. It was less a picture to
her than a presence; and the whole air of the little orange-garden
seemed to be made sacred by it. When she had
arranged her flowers, she kneeled down and began to say
prayers for the soul of the young gallant.</p>

<p>"Holy Jesus," she said, "he is young, rich, handsome,
and a king's brother; and for all these things the Fiend
may tempt him to forget his God and throw away his soul.
Holy Mother, give him good counsel!"</p>

<p>"Come, child, to your supper," said Dame Elsie. "I
have milked the goats, and everything is ready."</p>

<h2 class="vspace2"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />

<span class="smaller">THE GORGE</span></h2>

<p>After her light supper was over, Agnes took her distaff,
wound with shining white flax, and went and seated
herself in her favorite place, on the low parapet that overlooked
the gorge.</p>

<p>This ravine, with its dizzy depths, its waving foliage,
its dripping springs and the low murmur of the little
stream that pursued its way far down at the bottom, was
one of those things which stimulated her impressible imagination,
and filled her with a solemn and vague delight.
The ancient Italian tradition made it the home of fauns and
dryads, wild woodland creatures, intermediate links between
vegetable life and that of sentiment and reasoning humanity.
The more earnest faith that came in with Christianity,
if it had its brighter lights in an immortality of blessedness,
had also its deeper shadows in the intenser perceptions
it awakened of sin and evil, and of the mortal struggle by
which the human spirit must avoid endless woe and rise to
endless felicity. The myths with which the colored Italian
air was filled in mediæval ages no longer resembled those
graceful, floating, cloud-like figures one sees in the ancient
chambers of Pompeii,&mdash;the bubbles and rainbows of human
fancy, rising aimless and buoyant, with a mere freshness
of animal life, against a black background of utter and
hopeless ignorance as to man's past or future. They were
rather expressed by solemn images of mournful, majestic
angels and of triumphant saints, or fearful, warning presentations
of loathsome fiends. Each lonesome gorge and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
sombre dell had tales no more of tricky fauns and dryads,
but of those restless, wandering demons who, having lost
their own immortality of blessedness, constantly lie in wait
to betray frail humanity, and cheat it of that glorious
inheritance bought by the Great Redemption.</p>

<p>The education of Agnes had been one which rendered
her whole system peculiarly sensitive and impressible to all
influences from the invisible and unseen. Of this education
we shall speak more particularly hereafter. At present
we see her sitting in the twilight on the moss-grown
marble parapet, her distaff, with its silvery flax, lying idly
in her hands, and her widening dark eyes gazing intently
into the gloomy gorge below, from which arose the far-off
complaining babble of the brook at the bottom and the
shiver and sigh of evening winds through the trailing ivy.
The white mist was slowly rising, wavering, undulating,
and creeping its slow way up the sides of the gorge. Now
it hid a tuft of foliage, and now it wreathed itself around
a horned clump of aloes, and, streaming far down below
it in the dimness, made it seem like the goblin robe of
some strange, supernatural being.</p>

<p>The evening light had almost burned out in the sky;
only a band of vivid red lay low in the horizon out to sea,
and the round full moon was just rising like a great silver
lamp, while Vesuvius with its smoky top began in the obscurity
to show its faintly flickering fires. A vague agitation
seemed to oppress the child; for she sighed deeply,
and often repeated with fervor the Ave Maria.</p>

<p>At this moment there began to rise from the very depths
of the gorge below her the sound of a rich tenor voice, with
a slow, sad modulation, and seeming to pulsate upward
through the filmy, shifting mists. It was one of those
voices which seem fit to be the outpouring of some spirit
denied all other gifts of expression, and rushing with
passionate fervor through this one gate of utterance. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
distinctly were the words spoken, that they seemed each
one to rise as with a separate intelligence out of the mist,
and to knock at the door of the heart.</p>

<p>There was such an intense earnestness in these sounds,
that large tears gathered in the wide dark eyes, and fell
one after another upon the sweet alyssum and maiden's-hair
that grew in the crevices of the marble wall. She shivered
and drew away from the parapet, and thought of stories
she had heard the nuns tell of wandering spirits who sometimes
in lonesome places pour forth such entrancing music
as bewilders the brain of the unwary listener, and leads
him to some fearful destruction.</p>

<p>"Agnes!" said the sharp voice of old Elsie, appearing
at the door, "here! where are you?"</p>

<p>"Here, grandmamma."</p>

<p>"Who's that singing this time o' night?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, grandmamma."</p>

<p>Somehow the child felt as if that singing were strangely
sacred to her,&mdash;a <i>rapport</i> between her and something
vague and invisible which might yet become dear.</p>

<p>"Is't down in the gorge?" said the old woman, coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
with her heavy, decided step to the parapet, and looking
over, her keen black eyes gleaming like dagger-blades into
the mist. "If there's anybody there," she said, "let them
go away, and not be troubling honest women with any of
their caterwauling. Come, Agnes," she said, pulling the
girl by the sleeve, "you must be tired, my lamb! and your
evening prayers are always so long, best be about them,
girl, so that old grandmamma may put you to bed. What
ails the girl? Been crying! Your hand is cold as a
stone."</p>

<p>"Grandmamma, what if that might be a spirit?" she
said. "Sister Rosa told me stories of singing spirits that
have been in this very gorge."</p>

<p>"Likely enough," said Dame Elsie; "but what's that
to us? Let 'em sing!&mdash;so long as we don't listen,
where's the harm done? We will sprinkle holy water all
round the parapet, and say the office of Saint Agnes, and
let them sing till they are hoarse."</p>

<p>Such was the triumphant view which this energetic good
woman took of the power of the means of grace which her
church placed at her disposal.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, while Agnes was kneeling at her evening
prayers, the old dame consoled herself with a soliloquy, as
with a brush she vigorously besprinkled the premises with
holy water.</p>

<p>"Now, here's the plague of a girl! If she's handsome,&mdash;and
nobody wants one that isn't,&mdash;why, then, it's a
purgatory to look after her. This one is good enough,&mdash;none
of your hussies, like Giulietta: but the better they
are, the more sure to have fellows after them. A murrain
on that cavalier,&mdash;king's brother, or what not!&mdash;it was
he serenading, I'll be bound. I must tell Antonio, and
have the girl married, for aught I see: and I don't want
to give her to him either; he didn't bring her up.
There's no peace for us mothers. Maybe I'll tell Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Francesco about it. That's the way poor little Isella was
carried away. Singing is of the Devil, I believe; it always
bewitches girls. I'd like to have poured some hot oil
down the rocks: I'd have made him squeak in another
tone, I reckon. Well, well! I hope I shall come in for
a good seat in paradise for all the trouble I've had with
her mother, and am like to have with her,&mdash;that's all!"</p>

<p>In an hour more, the large, round, sober moon was shining
fixedly on the little mansion in the rocks, silvering the
glossy darkness of the orange-leaves, while the scent of the
blossoms arose like clouds about the cottage. The moonlight
streamed through the unglazed casement, and made
a square of light on the little bed where Agnes was sleeping,
in which square her delicate face was framed, with its
tremulous and spiritual expression most resembling in its
sweet plaintive purity some of the Madonna faces of Fra
Angelico,&mdash;those tender wild flowers of Italian religion
and poetry.</p>

<p>By her side lay her grandmother, with those sharp, hard,
clearly cut features, so worn and bronzed by time, so lined
with labor and care, as to resemble one of the Fates in the
picture of Michel Angelo; and even in her sleep she held
the delicate lily hand of the child in her own hard, brown
one, with a strong and determined clasp.</p>

<p>While they sleep, we must tell something more of the
story of the little Agnes,&mdash;of what she is, and what are
the causes which have made her such.</p>

<span class="smaller">WHO AND WHAT</span></h2>

<p>Old Elsie was not born a peasant. Originally she was
the wife of a steward in one of those great families of
Rome whose estate and traditions were princely. Elsie, as
her figure and profile and all her words and movements indicated,
was of a strong, shrewd, ambitious, and courageous
character, and well disposed to turn to advantage every
gift with which Nature had endowed her.</p>

<p>Providence made her a present of a daughter whose
beauty was wonderful, even in a country where beauty is
no uncommon accident. In addition to her beauty, the
little Isella had quick intelligence, wit, grace, and spirit.
As a child she became the pet and plaything of the Princess
whom Elsie served. This noble lady, pressed by the
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ennui</i> which is always the moth and rust on the purple
and gold of rank and wealth, had, as other noble ladies
had in those days, and have now, sundry pets: greyhounds,
white and delicate, that looked as if they were
made of Sèvres china; spaniels with long silky ears and
fringy paws; apes and monkeys, that made at times sad
devastations in her wardrobe; and a most charming little
dwarf, that was ugly enough to frighten the very owls,
and spiteful as he was ugly. She had, moreover, peacocks,
and macaws, and parrots, and all sorts of singing-birds, and
falcons of every breed, and horses, and hounds,&mdash;in short,
there is no saying what she did <i>not</i> have. One day she
took it into her head to add the little Isella to the number
of her acquisitions. With the easy grace of aristocracy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
she reached out her jeweled hand and took Elsie's one
flower to add to her conservatory,&mdash;and Elsie was only
too proud to have it so.</p>

<p>Her daughter was kept constantly about the person of
the Princess, and instructed in all the wisdom which would
have been allowed her, had she been the Princess's own
daughter, which, to speak the truth, was in those days
nothing very profound,&mdash;consisting of a little singing and
instrumentation, a little embroidery and dancing, with the
power of writing her own name and of reading a love
letter.</p>

<p>All the world knows that the very idea of a pet is something
to be spoiled for the amusement of the pet-owner;
and Isella was spoiled in the most particular and circumstantial
manner. She had suits of apparel for every day
in the year, and jewels without end,&mdash;for the Princess
was never weary of trying the effect of her beauty in this
and that costume; so that she sported through the great
grand halls and down the long aisles of the garden much
like a bright-winged humming-bird, or a damsel-fly all
green and gold. She was a genuine child of Italy,&mdash;full
of feeling, spirit, and genius,&mdash;alive in every nerve to the
finger-tips; and under the tropical sunshine of her mistress's
favor she grew as an Italian rosebush does, throwing
its branches freakishly over everything in a wild labyrinth
of perfume, brightness, and thorns.</p>

<p>For a while her life was a triumph, and her mother triumphed
with her at an humble distance. The Princess
was devoted to her with the blind fatuity with which
ladies of rank at times will invest themselves in a caprice.
She arrogated to herself all the praises of her beauty and
wit, allowed her to flirt and make conquests to her heart's
content, and engaged to marry her to some handsome young
officer of her train, when she had done being amused with
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Now we must not wonder that a young head of fifteen
should have been turned by this giddy elevation, nor that
an old head of fifty should have thought all things were
possible in the fortune of such a favorite. Nor must we
wonder that the young coquette, rich in the laurels of a
hundred conquests, should have turned her bright eyes on
the son and heir, when he came home from the University
of Bologna. Nor is it to be wondered at, that this same
son and heir, being a man as well as a Prince, should have
done as other men did,&mdash;fallen desperately in love with
this dazzling, sparkling, piquant mixture of matter and
spirit, which no university can prepare a young man to
comprehend,&mdash;which always seemed to run from him, and
yet always threw a Parthian shot behind her as she fled.
Nor is it to be wondered at, if this same Prince, after a
week or two, did not know whether he was on his head or
his heels, or whether the sun rose in the east or the south,
or where he stood, or whither he was going.</p>

<p>In fact, the youthful pair very soon came into that
dreamland where are no more any points of the compass,
no more division of time, no more latitude and longitude,
no more up and down, but only a general wandering among
enchanted groves and singing nightingales.</p>

<p>It was entirely owing to old Elsie's watchful shrewdness
and address that the lovers came into this paradise by the
gate of marriage; for the young man was ready to offer
anything at the feet of his divinity, as the old mother was
not slow to perceive.</p>

<p>So they stood at the altar for the time being a pair of as
true lovers as Romeo and Juliet: but then, what has true
love to do with the son of a hundred generations and heir
to a Roman principality?</p>

<p>Of course, the rose of love, having gone through all its
stages of bud and blossom into full flower, must next begin
to drop its leaves. Of course. Who ever heard of an
immortal rose?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
The time of discovery came. Isella was found to be a
mother; and then the storm burst upon her and drabbled
her in the dust as fearlessly as the summer wind sweeps
down and besmirches the lily it has all summer been wooing
and flattering.</p>

<p>The Princess was a very pious and moral lady, and of
course threw her favorite out into the street as a vile weed,
and virtuously ground her down under her jeweled high-heeled
shoes.</p>

<p>She could have forgiven her any common frailty; of
course it was natural that the girl should have been seduced
by the all-conquering charms of her son,&mdash;but aspire to
marriage with their house!&mdash;pretend to be her son's
wife! Since the time of Judas had such treachery ever
been heard of?</p>

<p>Something was said of the propriety of walling up the
culprit alive,&mdash;a mode of disposing of small family matters
somewhat <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à la mode</i> in those times. But the Princess
acknowledged herself foolishly tender, and unable quite to
allow this very obvious propriety in the case.</p>

<p>She contented herself with turning mother and daughter
into the streets with every mark of ignominy, which was
reduplicated by every one of her servants, lackeys, and
court-companions, who, of course, had always known just
how the thing must end.</p>

<p>As to the young Prince, he acted as a well-instructed
young nobleman should, who understands the great difference
there is between the tears of a duchess and those of
low-born women. No sooner did he behold his conduct in
the light of his mother's countenance than he turned his
back on his low marriage with edifying penitence. He
did not think it necessary to convince his mother of the
real existence of a union whose very supposition made her
so unhappy, and occasioned such an uncommonly disagreeable
and tempestuous state of things in the well-bred circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
where his birth called him to move. Being, however, a
religious youth, he opened his mind to his family-confessor,
by whose advice he sent a messenger with a large sum of
money to Elsie, piously commending her and her daughter
to the Divine protection. He also gave orders for an entire
new suit of raiment for the Virgin Mary in the family
chapel, including a splendid set of diamonds, and promised
unlimited candles to the altar of a neighboring convent.
If all this could not atone for a youthful error, it was a
pity. So he thought, as he drew on his riding gloves and
went off on a hunting party, like a gallant and religious
young nobleman.</p>

<p>Elsie, meanwhile, with her forlorn and disgraced daughter,
found a temporary asylum in a neighboring mountain
village, where the poor, bedrabbled, broken-winged song-bird
soon panted and fluttered her little life away.</p>

<p>When the once beautiful and gay Isella had been hidden
in the grave, cold and lonely, there remained a little wailing
infant, which Elsie gathered to her bosom.</p>

<p>Grim, dauntless, and resolute, she resolved, for the sake
of this hapless one, to look life in the face once more, and
try the battle under other skies.</p>

<p>Taking the infant in her arms, she traveled with her far
from the scene of her birth, and set all her energies at
work to make for her a better destiny than that which had
fallen to the lot of her unfortunate mother.</p>

<p>She set about to create her nature and order her fortunes
with that sort of downright energy with which resolute
people always attack the problem of a new human existence.
This child should be happy: the rocks on which
her mother was wrecked she should never strike upon,&mdash;they
were all marked on Elsie's chart. Love had been the
root of all poor Isella's troubles,&mdash;and Agnes never should
know love, till taught it safely by a husband of Elsie's own
choosing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
The first step of security was in naming her for the
chaste Saint Agnes, and placing her girlhood under her
special protection. Secondly, which was quite as much to
the point, she brought her up laboriously in habits of incessant
industry,&mdash;never suffering her to be out of her
sight, or to have any connection or friendship, except such
as could be carried on under the immediate supervision of
her piercing black eyes. Every night she put her to bed
as if she had been an infant, and, wakening her again in
the morning, took her with her in all her daily toils,&mdash;of
which, to do her justice, she performed all the hardest
portion, leaving to the girl just enough to keep her hands
employed and her head steady.</p>

<p>The peculiar circumstance which had led her to choose
the old town of Sorrento for her residence, in preference to
any of the beautiful villages which impearl that fertile
plain, was the existence there of a flourishing convent
dedicated to Saint Agnes, under whose protecting shadow
her young charge might more securely spend the earlier
years of her life.</p>

<p>With this view, having hired the domicile we have already
described, she lost no time in making the favorable
acquaintance of the sisterhood,&mdash;never coming to them
empty-handed. The finest oranges of her garden, the
whitest flax of her spinning, were always reserved as offerings
at the shrine of the patroness whom she sought to
propitiate for her grandchild.</p>

<p>In her earliest childhood the little Agnes was led toddling
to the shrine by her zealous relative, and at the sight
of her fair, sweet, awestruck face, with its viny mantle of
encircling curls, the torpid bosoms of the sisterhood
throbbed with a strange, new pleasure, which they humbly
hoped was not sinful,&mdash;as agreeable things, they found,
generally were. They loved the echoes of her little feet
down the damp, silent aisles of their chapel, and her small,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
sweet, slender voice, as she asked strange baby-questions,
which, as usual with baby-questions, hit all the insoluble
points of philosophy and theology exactly on the head.</p>

<p>The child became a special favorite with the Abbess,
Sister Theresa, a tall, thin, bloodless, sad-eyed woman,
who looked as if she might have been cut out of one of the
glaciers of Monte Rosa, but in whose heart the little fair
one had made herself a niche, pushing her way up through,
as you may have seen a lovely blue-fringed gentian standing
in a snowdrift of the Alps with its little ring of melted
snow around it.</p>

<p>Sister Theresa offered to take care of the child at any
time when the grandmother wished to be about her labors;
and so, during her early years, the little one was often
domesticated for days together at the Convent. A perfect
mythology of wonderful stories encircled her, which the
good sisters were never tired of repeating to each other.
They were the simplest sayings and doings of childhood,&mdash;handfuls
of such wild flowers as bespread the green turf
of nursery-life everywhere, but miraculous blossoms in the
eyes of these good women, whom Saint Agnes had unwittingly
deprived of any power of making comparisons or
ever having Christ's sweetest parable of the heavenly kingdom
enacted in homes of their own.</p>

<p>Old Jocunda, the portress, never failed to make a sensation
with her one stock-story of how she found the child
standing on her head and crying,&mdash;having been put into
this reversed position in consequence of climbing up on a
high stool to get her little fat hand into the vase of holy
water, failing in which Christian attempt, her heels went
up and her head down, greatly to her dismay.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said old Jocunda, gravely, "it showed
an edifying turn in the child; and when I lifted the little
thing up, it stopped crying the minute its little fingers
touched the water, and it made a cross on its forehead as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
sensible as the oldest among us. Ah, sisters, there's grace
there, or I'm mistaken."</p>

<p>All the signs of an incipient saint were, indeed, manifested
in the little one. She never played the wild and
noisy plays of common children, but busied herself in making
altars and shrines, which she adorned with the prettiest
flowers of the gardens, and at which she worked hour after
hour in the quietest and happiest earnestness. Her dreams
were a constant source of wonder and edification in the
Convent, for they were all of angels and saints; and many
a time, after hearing one, the sisterhood crossed themselves,
and the Abbess said, "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ex oribus parvulorum</i>." Always
sweet, dutiful, submissive, cradling herself every night
with a lulling of sweet hymns and infant murmur of
prayers, and found sleeping in her little white bed with
her crucifix clasped to her bosom, it was no wonder that
the Abbess thought her the special favorite of her divine
patroness, and like her the subject of an early vocation to
be the celestial bride of One fairer than the children of
men, who should snatch her away from all earthly things,
to be united to Him in a celestial paradise.</p>

<p>As the child grew older, she often sat at evening with
wide, wondering eyes, listening over and over again to the
story of the fair Saint Agnes,&mdash;how she was a princess,
living in her father's palace, of such exceeding beauty and
grace that none saw her but to love her, yet of such sweetness
and humility as passed all comparison; and how, when
a heathen prince would have espoused her to his son, she
said, "Away from me, tempter! for I am betrothed to a
lover who is greater and fairer than any earthly suitor,&mdash;he
is so fair that the sun and moon are ravished by his
beauty, so mighty that the angels of heaven are his servants;"
how she bore meekly with persecutions and threatenings
and death for the sake of this unearthly love; and
when she had poured out her blood, how she came to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
mourning friends in ecstatic vision, all white and glistening,
with a fair lamb by her side, and bade them weep not
for her, because she was reigning with Him whom on earth
she had preferred to all other lovers. There was also the
legend of the fair Cecilia, the lovely musician whom angels
had rapt away to their choirs; the story of that queenly
saint, Catharine, who passed through the courts of heaven,
and saw the angels crowned with roses and lilies, and the
Virgin on her throne, who gave her the wedding ring that
espoused her to be the bride of the King Eternal.</p>

<p>Fed with such legends, it could not be but that a child
with a sensitive, nervous organization and vivid imagination,
should have grown up with an unworldly and spiritual
character, and that a poetic mist should have enveloped
all her outward perceptions similar to that palpitating veil
of blue and lilac vapor that enshrouds the Italian landscape.</p>

<p>Nor is it to be marveled at, if the results of this system
of education went far beyond what the good old grandmother
intended. For, though a stanch good Christian, after the
manner of those times, yet she had not the slightest mind
to see her grand-daughter a nun; on the contrary, she was
working day and night to add to her dowry, and had in
her eye a reputable middle-aged blacksmith, who was a man
of substance and prudence, to be the husband and keeper
of her precious treasure. In a home thus established she
hoped to enthrone herself, and provide for the rearing of
a generation of stout-limbed girls and boys who should
grow up to make a flourishing household in the land. This
subject she had not yet broached to her grand-daughter,
though daily preparing to do so,&mdash;deferring it, it must be
told, from a sort of jealous, yearning craving to have wholly
to herself the child for whom she had lived so many years.</p>

<p>Antonio, the blacksmith to whom this honor was destined,
was one of those broad-backed, full-chested, long-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>limbed
fellows one shall often see around Sorrento, with
great, kind, black eyes like those of an ox, and all the
attributes of a healthy, kindly, animal nature. Contentedly
he hammered away at his business; and certainly, had not
Dame Elsie of her own providence elected him to be the
husband of her fair grand-daughter, he would never have
thought of the matter himself; but, opening the black eyes
aforenamed upon the girl, he perceived that she was fair,
and also received an inner light through Dame Elsie as to
the amount of her dowry; and, putting these matters
together, conceived a kindness for the maiden, and awaited
with tranquillity the time when he should be allowed to
commence his wooing.</p>

<span class="smaller">IL PADRE FRANCESCO</span></h2>

<p>The next morning Elsie awoke, as was her custom,
when the very faintest hue of dawn streaked the horizon.
A hen who has seen a hawk balancing his wings and cawing
in mid-air over her downy family could not have awakened
with her feathers, metaphorically speaking, in a more
bristling state of caution.</p>

<p>"Spirits in the gorge, quotha?" said she to herself, as
she vigorously adjusted her dress. "I believe so,&mdash;spirits
in good sound bodies, I believe; and next we shall hear,
there will be rope-ladders, and climbings, and the Lord
knows what. I shall go to confession this very morning,
and tell Father Francesco the danger; and instead of taking
her down to sell oranges, suppose I send her to the
sisters to carry the ring and a basket of oranges?"</p>

<p>"Ah, ah!" she said, pausing, after she was dressed, and
addressing a coarse print of Saint Agnes pasted against the
wall,&mdash;"you look very meek there, and it was a great
thing, no doubt, to die as you did; but if you'd lived to
be married and bring up a family of girls, you'd have
known something greater. Please, don't take offense with
a poor old woman who has got into the way of speaking
her mind freely! I'm foolish, and don't know much,&mdash;so,
dear lady, pray for me!" And old Elsie bent her knee
and crossed herself reverently, and then went out, leaving
her young charge still sleeping.</p>

<p>It was yet dusky dawn when she might have been seen
kneeling, with her sharp, clear-cut profile, at the grate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
a confession-box in a church in Sorrento. Within was
seated a personage who will have some influence on our
story, and who must therefore be somewhat minutely introduced
to the reader.</p>

<p>Il Padre Francesco had only within the last year arrived
in the neighborhood, having been sent as superior of a
brotherhood of Capuchins, whose convent was perched on
a crag in the vicinity. With this situation came a pastoral
care of the district; and Elsie and her grand-daughter
found in him a spiritual pastor very different from the fat,
jolly, easy Brother Girolamo, to whose place he had been
appointed. The latter had been one of those numerous
priests taken from the peasantry, who never rise above the
average level of thought of the body from which they are
drawn. Easy, gossipy, fond of good living and good stories,
sympathetic in troubles and in joys, he had been a
general favorite in the neighborhood, without exerting any
particularly spiritualizing influence.</p>

<p>It required but a glance at Father Francesco to see that
he was in all respects the opposite of this. It was evident
that he came from one of the higher classes, by that indefinable
air of birth and breeding which makes itself felt
under every change of costume. Who he might be, what
might have been his past history, what rank he might have
borne, what part played in the great warfare of life, was
all of course sunk in the oblivion of his religious profession,
where, as at the grave, a man laid down name and
fame and past history and worldly goods, and took up a
coarse garb and a name chosen from the roll of the saints,
in sign that the world that had known him should know
him no more.</p>

<p>Imagine a man between thirty and forty, with that
round, full, evenly developed head, and those chiseled
features, which one sees on ancient busts and coins no less
than in the streets of modern Rome. The cheeks were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
sunken and sallow; the large, black, melancholy eyes had
a wistful, anxious, penetrative expression, that spoke a
stringent, earnest spirit, which, however deep might be the
grave in which it lay buried, had not yet found repose.
The long, thin, delicately formed hands were emaciated
and bloodless; they clasped with a nervous eagerness a
rosary and crucifix of ebony and silver,&mdash;the only mark of
luxury that could be discerned in a costume unusually
threadbare and squalid. The whole picture of the man,
as he sat there, had it been painted and hung in a gallery,
was such as must have stopped every person of a certain
amount of sensibility before it with the conviction that
behind that strong, melancholy, earnest figure and face lay
one of those hidden histories of human passion in which
the vivid life of mediæval Italy was so fertile.</p>

<p>He was listening to Elsie, as she kneeled, with that easy
air of superiority which marks a practiced man of the
world, yet with a grave attention which showed that her
communication had awakened the deepest interest in his
mind. Every few moments he moved slightly in his seat,
and interrupted the flow of the narrative by an inquiry
concisely put, in tones which, clear and low, had a solemn
and severe distinctness, producing, in the still, dusky twilight
of the church, an almost ghostly effect.</p>

<p>When the communication was over, he stepped out
of the confessional and said to Elsie in parting, "My
daughter, you have done well to take this in time. The
devices of Satan in our corrupt times are numerous and
artful, and they who keep the Lord's sheep must not sleep.
Before many days I will call and examine the child; meanwhile
I approve your course."</p>

<p>It was curious to see the awestruck, trembling manner
in which old Elsie, generally so intrepid and commanding,
stood before this man in his brown rough woolen gown
with his corded waist; but she had an instinctive perception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
of the presence of the man of superior birth no less
than a reverence for the man of religion.</p>

<p>After she had departed from the church, the Capuchin
stood lost in thought; and to explain his revery, we must
throw some further light on his history.</p>

<p>Il Padre Francesco, as his appearance and manner intimated,
was in truth from one of the most distinguished
families of Florence. He was one of those whom an
ancient writer characterizes as "men of longing desire."
Born with a nature of restless stringency that seemed to
doom him never to know repose, excessive in all things,
he had made early trial of ambition, of war, and of what
the gallants of his time called love,&mdash;plunging into all the
dissipated excesses of a most dissolute age, and outdoing in
luxury and extravagance the foremost of his companions.</p>

<p>The wave of a great religious impulse&mdash;which in our
times would have been called a revival&mdash;swept over the
city of Florence, and bore him, with multitudes of others,
to listen to the fervid preaching of the Dominican monk,
Jerome Savonarola; and amid the crowd that trembled,
wept, and beat their breasts under his awful denunciations,
he, too, felt within himself a heavenly call,&mdash;the death of
an old life, and the uprising of a new purpose.</p>

<p>The colder manners and more repressed habits of modern
times can give no idea of the wild fervor of a religious
revival among a people so passionate and susceptible to
impressions as the Italians. It swept society like a spring
torrent from the sides of the Apennines, bearing all before
it. Houses were sacked with religious fervor by penitent
owners, and licentious pictures and statuary and books, and
all the thousand temptations and appliances of a luxurious
age, were burned in the great public square. Artists convicted
of impure and licentious designs threw their palettes
and brushes into the expiatory flames, and retired to convents,
till called forth by the voice of the preacher, and bid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
to turn their art into higher channels. Since the days of
Saint Francis no such profound religious impulse had agitated
the Italian community.</p>

<p>In our times a conversion is signalized by few outward
changes, however deep the inner life; but the life of the
Middle Ages was profoundly symbolical, and always required
the help of material images in its expression.</p>

<p>The gay and dissolute young Lorenzo Sforza took leave
of the world with rites of awful solemnity. He made his
will and disposed of all his worldly property, and assembling
his friends, bade them the farewell of a dying man.
Arrayed as for the grave, he was laid in his coffin, and
thus carried from his stately dwelling by the brethren of
the Misericordia, who, in their ghostly costume, with
mournful chants and lighted candles, bore him to the tomb
of his ancestors, where the coffin was deposited in the
vault, and its occupant passed the awful hours of the night
in darkness and solitude. Thence he was carried, the next
day, almost in a state of insensibility, to a neighboring
convent of the severest order, where, for some weeks, he
observed a penitential retreat of silence and prayer, neither
seeing nor hearing any living being but his spiritual director.</p>

<p>The effect of all this on an ardent and sensitive temperament
can scarcely be conceived; and it is not to be wondered
at that the once gay and luxurious Lorenzo Sforza,
when emerging from this tremendous discipline, was so
wholly lost in the worn and weary Padre Francesco that it
seemed as if in fact he had died and another had stepped
into his place. The face was ploughed deep with haggard
furrows, and the eyes were as those of a man who has seen
the fearful secrets of another life. He voluntarily sought
a post as far removed as possible from the scenes of his
early days, so as more completely to destroy his identity
with the past; and he devoted himself with enthusiasm to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
the task of awakening to a higher spiritual life the indolent,
self-indulgent monks of his order, and the ignorant peasantry
of the vicinity.</p>

<p>But he soon discovered, what every earnest soul learns
who has been baptized into a sense of things invisible, how
utterly powerless and inert any mortal man is to inspire
others with his own insights and convictions. With bitter
discouragement and chagrin, he saw that the spiritual man
must forever lift the dead weight of all the indolence and
indifference and animal sensuality that surround him,&mdash;that
the curse of Cassandra is upon him, forever to burn
and writhe under awful visions of truths which no one
around him will regard. In early life the associate only
of the cultivated and the refined, Father Francesco could
not but experience at times an insupportable <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ennui</i> in listening
to the confessions of people who had never learned
either to think or to feel with any degree of distinctness,
and whom his most fervent exhortations could not lift
above the most trivial interests of a mere animal life. He
was weary of the childish quarrels and bickerings of the
monks, of their puerility, of their selfishness and self-indulgence,
of their hopeless vulgarity of mind, and utterly
discouraged with their inextricable labyrinths of deception.
A melancholy deep as the grave seized on him, and he
redoubled his austerities, in the hope that by making life
painful he might make it also short.</p>

<p>But the first time that the clear, sweet tones of Agnes
rang in his ears at the confessional, and her words, so full
of unconscious poetry and repressed genius, came like a
strain of sweet music through the grate, he felt at his heart
a thrill to which it had long been a stranger, and which
seemed to lift the weary, aching load from off his soul, as
if some invisible angel had borne it up on his wings.</p>

<p>In his worldly days he had known women as the gallants
in Boccaccio's romances knew them, and among them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
one enchantress whose sorceries had kindled in his heart
one of those fatal passions which burn out the whole of a
man's nature, and leave it, like a sacked city, only a smouldering
heap of ashes. Deepest, therefore, among his vows
of renunciation had been those which divided him from all
womankind. The gulf that parted him and them was in
his mind deep as hell, and he thought of the sex only in
the light of temptation and danger. For the first time in
his life, an influence serene, natural, healthy, and sweet
breathed over him from the mind of a woman,&mdash;an influence
so heavenly and peaceful that he did not challenge or
suspect it, but rather opened his worn heart insensibly to
it, as one in a fetid chamber naturally breathes freer when
the fresh air is admitted.</p>

<p>How charming it was to find his most spiritual exhortations
seized upon with the eager comprehension of a nature
innately poetic and ideal! Nay, it sometimes seemed to
him as if the suggestions which he gave her dry and leafless
she brought again to him in miraculous clusters of
flowers, like the barren rod of Joseph, which broke into
blossoms when he was betrothed to the spotless Mary; and
yet, withal, she was so humbly unconscious, so absolutely
ignorant of the beauty of all she said and thought, that she
impressed him less as a mortal woman than as one of those
divine miracles in feminine form of which he had heard in
the legends of the saints.</p>

<p>Thenceforward his barren, discouraged life began to
blossom with wayside flowers,&mdash;and he mistrusted not the
miracle, because the flowers were all heavenly. The pious
thought or holy admonition that he saw trodden under the
swinish feet of the monks he gathered up again in hope,&mdash;<i>she</i>
would understand it; and gradually all his thoughts
became like carrier-doves, which, having once learned the
way to a favorite haunt, are ever fluttering to return
thither.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Such is the wonderful power of human sympathy, that
the discovery even of the existence of a soul capable of understanding
our inner life often operates as a perfect charm;
every thought, and feeling, and aspiration carries with it
a new value, from the interwoven consciousness that attends
it of the worth it would bear to that other mind; so that,
while that person lives, our existence is doubled in value,
even though oceans divide us.</p>

<p>The cloud of hopeless melancholy which had brooded
over the mind of Father Francesco lifted and sailed away,
he knew not why, he knew not when. A secret joyfulness
and alacrity possessed his spirits; his prayers became
more fervent and his praises more frequent. Until now,
his meditations had been most frequently those of fear and
wrath,&mdash;the awful majesty of God, the terrible punishment
of sinners, which he conceived with all that haggard,
dreadful sincerity of vigor which characterized the modern
Etruscan phase of religion of which the "Inferno" of Dante
was the exponent and the outcome. His preachings and
his exhortations had dwelt on that lurid world seen by the
severe Florentine, at whose threshold hope forever departs,
and around whose eternal circles of living torture the shivering
spirit wanders dismayed and blasted by terror.</p>

<p>He had been shocked and discouraged to find how utterly
vain had been his most intense efforts to stem the
course of sin by presenting these images of terror: how
hard natures had listened to them with only a coarse and
cruel appetite, which seemed to increase their hardness and
brutality; and how timid ones had been withered by them,
like flowers scorched by the blast of a furnace; how, in
fact, as in the case of those cruel executions and bloody
tortures then universal in the jurisprudence of Europe,
these pictures of eternal torture seemed to exert a morbid
demoralizing influence which hurried on the growth of
iniquity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
But since his acquaintance with Agnes, without his
knowing exactly why, thoughts of the Divine Love had
floated into his soul, filling it with a golden cloud like that
which of old rested over the mercy-seat in that sacred inner
temple where the priest was admitted alone. He became
more affable and tender, more tolerant to the erring, more
fond of little children; would stop sometimes to lay his
hand on the head of a child, or to raise up one who lay
overthrown in the street. The song of little birds and the
voices of animal life became to him full of tenderness; and
his prayers by the sick and dying seemed to have a melting
power, such as he had never known before. It was spring
in his soul,&mdash;soft, Italian spring,&mdash;such as brings out
the musky breath of the cyclamen, and the faint, tender
perfume of the primrose, in every moist dell of the Apennines.</p>

<p>A year passed in this way, perhaps the best and happiest
of his troubled life,&mdash;a year in which, insensibly to himself,
the weekly interviews with Agnes at the confessional
became the rallying points around which the whole of his
life was formed, and she the unsuspected spring of his inner
being.</p>

<p>It was his duty, he said to himself, to give more than
usual time and thought to the working and polishing of
this wondrous jewel which had so unexpectedly been intrusted
to him for the adorning of his Master's crown; and
so long as he conducted with the strictest circumspection of
his office, what had he to fear in the way of so delightful
a duty? He had never touched her hand; never had even
the folds of her passing drapery brushed against his garments
of mortification and renunciation; never, even in
pastoral benediction, had he dared lay his hand on that
beautiful head. It is true, he had not forbidden himself
to raise his glance sometimes when he saw her coming in
at the church door and gliding up the aisle with downcast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
eyes, and thoughts evidently so far above earth that she
seemed, like one of Fra Angelico's angels, to be moving on
a cloud, so encompassed with stillness and sanctity that he
held his breath as she passed.</p>

<p>But in the confession of Dame Elsie that morning he
had received a shock which threw his whole interior being
into a passionate agitation which dismayed and astonished
him.</p>

<p>The thought of Agnes, his spotless lamb, exposed to
lawless and licentious pursuit, of whose nature and probabilities
his past life gave him only too clear an idea, was
of itself a very natural source of anxiety. But Elsie had
unveiled to him her plans for her marriage, and consulted
him on the propriety of placing Agnes immediately under
the protection of the husband she had chosen for her; and
it was this part of her communication which had awakened
the severest internal recoil, and raised a tumult of passions
which the priest vainly sought either to assuage or
understand.</p>

<p>As soon as his morning duties were over, he repaired to
his convent, sought his cell, and, prostrate on his face before
the crucifix, began his internal reckoning with himself.
The day passed in fasting and solitude.</p>

<p>It is now golden evening, and on the square, flat roof of
the convent, which, high-perched on a crag, overlooks the
bay, one might observe a dark figure slowly pacing backward
and forward. It is Father Francesco; and as he
walks up and down, one could see by his large, bright, dilated
eye, by the vivid red spot on either sunken cheek,
and by the nervous energy of his movements, that he is in
the very height of some mental crisis,&mdash;in that state of
placid <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">extase</i> in which the subject supposes himself perfectly
calm, because every nerve is screwed to the highest
point of tension and can vibrate no more.</p>

<p>What oceans had that day rolled over him and swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
him, as one may see a little boat rocked on the capricious
surges of the Mediterranean! Were, then, all his strivings
and agonies in vain? Did he love this woman with any
earthly love? Was he jealous of the thought of a future
husband? Was it a tempting demon that said to him,
"Lorenzo Sforza might have shielded this treasure from
the profanation of lawless violence, from the brute grasp
of an inappreciative peasant, but Father Francesco cannot"?
There was a moment when his whole being vibrated with
a perception of what a marriage bond might have been that
was indeed a sacrament, and that bound together two pure
and loyal souls who gave life and courage to each other in
all holy purposes and heroic deeds; and he almost feared
that he had cursed his vows,&mdash;those awful vows, at whose
remembrance his inmost soul shivered through every nerve.</p>

<p>But after hours of prayer and struggle, and wave after
wave of agonizing convulsion, he gained one of those high
points in human possibility where souls can stand a little
while at a time, and where all things seem so transfigured
and pure that they fancy themselves thenceforward forever
victorious over evil.</p>

<p>As he walks up and down in the gold-and-purple evening
twilight, his mind seems to him calm as that glowing
sea that reflects the purple shores of Ischia, and the quaint,
fantastic grottoes and cliffs of Capri. All is golden and
glowing; he sees all clear; he is delivered from his spiritual
enemies; he treads them under his feet.</p>

<p>Yes, he says to himself, he loves Agnes,&mdash;loves her all-sacredly
as her guardian angel does, who ever beholdeth
the face of her Father in Heaven. Why, then, does he
shrink from her marriage? Is it not evident? Has that
tender soul, that poetic nature, that aspiring genius, anything
in common with the vulgar coarse details of a peasant's
life? Will not her beauty always draw the eye of
the licentious, expose her artless innocence to solicitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
which will annoy her and bring upon her head the inconsiderate
jealousy of her husband? Think of Agnes made
subject to the rude authority, to the stripes and correction,
which men of the lower class, under the promptings of
jealousy, do not scruple to inflict on their wives! What
career did society, as then organized, present to such a
nature, so perilously gifted in body and mind? He has
the answer. The Church has opened a career to woman
which all the world denies her.</p>

<p>He remembers the story of the dyer's daughter of Siena,
the fair Saint Catharine. In his youth he had often visited
the convent where one of the first artists of Italy has immortalized
her conflicts and her victories, and knelt with
his mother at the altar where she now communes with the
faithful. He remembered how, by her sanctity, her humility,
and her holy inspirations of soul, she had risen to
the courts of princes, whither she had been sent as ambassadress
to arrange for the interests of the Church; and then
rose before his mind's eye the gorgeous picture of Pinturicchio,
where, borne in celestial repose and purity amid all
the powers and dignitaries of the Church, she is canonized
as one of those that shall reign and intercede with Christ
in heaven.</p>

<p>Was it wrong, therefore, in him, though severed from
all womankind by a gulf of irrevocable vows, that he should
feel a kind of jealous property in this gifted and beautiful
creature? and though he might not, even in thought,
dream of possessing her himself, was there sin in the vehement
energy with which his whole nature rose up in him
to say that no other man should,&mdash;that she should be the
bride of Heaven alone?</p>

<p>Certainly, if there were, it lurked far out of sight, and
the priest had a case that might have satisfied a conscience
even more fastidious; and he felt a sort of triumph in
the results of his mental scrutiny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Yes, she should ascend from glory to glory,&mdash;but his
should be the hand that should lead her upward. He
would lead her within the consecrated grate,&mdash;he would
pronounce the awful words that should make it sacrilege
for all other men to approach her; and yet through life he
should be the guardian and director of her soul, the one
being to whom she should render an obedience as unlimited
as that which belongs to Christ alone.</p>

<p>Such were the thoughts of this victorious hour, which,
alas! were destined to fade as those purple skies and golden
fires gradually went out, leaving, in place of their light
and glory, only the lurid glow of Vesuvius.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE WALK TO THE CONVENT</span></h2>

<p>Elsie returned from the confessional a little after sunrise,
much relieved and satisfied. Padre Francesco had
shown such a deep interest in her narrative that she was
highly gratified. Then he had given her advice which
exactly accorded with her own views; and such advice is
always regarded as an eminent proof of sagacity in the
giver.</p>

<p>On the point of the marriage he had recommended delay,&mdash;a
course quite in accordance with Elsie's desire, who,
curiously enough, ever since her treaty of marriage with
Antonio had been commenced, had cherished the most
whimsical, jealous dislike of him, as if he were about to
get away her grandchild from her; and this rose at times
so high that she could scarcely speak peaceably to him,&mdash;a
course of things which caused Antonio to open wide
his great soft ox-eyes, and wonder at the ways of womankind;
but he waited the event in philosophic tranquillity.</p>

<p>The morning sunbeams were shooting many a golden
shaft among the orange-trees when Elsie returned and
found Agnes yet kneeling at her prayers.</p>

<p>"Now, my little heart," said the old woman, when their
morning meal was done, "I am going to give you a holiday
to-day. I will go with you to the Convent, and you shall
spend the day with the sisters, and so carry Saint Agnes
her ring."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, grandmamma! how good you are!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
May I stop a little on the way, and pick some cyclamen
and myrtles and daisies for her shrine?"</p>

<p>"Just as you like, child; but if you are going to do
that, we must be off soon, for I must be at my stand betimes
to sell oranges: I had them all picked this morning
while my little darling was asleep."</p>

<p>"You always do everything, grandmamma, and leave me
nothing to do: it is not fair. But, grandmamma, if we
are going to get flowers by the way, let us follow down the
stream, through the gorge, out upon the sea-beach, and
so walk along the sands, and go by the back path up the
rocks to the Convent: that walk is so shady and lovely at
this time in the morning, and it is so fresh along by the
seaside!"</p>

<p>"As you please, dearie; but first fill a little basket with
our best oranges for the sisters."</p>

<p>"Trust me for that!" And the girl ran eagerly to the
house, and drew from her treasures a little white wicker
basket, which she proceeded to line curiously with orange-leaves,
sticking sprays of blossoms in a wreath round the
border.</p>

<p>"Now for some of our best blood-oranges!" she said;
"old Jocunda says they put her in mind of pomegranates.
And here are some of these little ones,&mdash;see here, grandmamma!"
she exclaimed as she turned and held up a branch
just broken, where five small golden balls grew together
with a pearly spray of white buds just beyond them.</p>

<p>The exercise of springing up for the branch had sent a
vivid glow into her clear brown cheek, and her eyes were
dilated with excitement and pleasure; and as she stood
joyously holding the branch, while the flickering shadows
fell on her beautiful face, she seemed more like a painter's
dream than a reality.</p>

<p>Her grandmother stood a moment admiring her.</p>

<p>"She's too good and too pretty for Antonio or any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
man: she ought to be kept to look at," she said to herself.
"If I could keep her always, no man should have her; but
death will come, and youth and beauty go, and so somebody
must care for her."</p>

<p>When the basket was filled and trimmed, Agnes took it
on her arm. Elsie raised and poised on her head the great
square basket that contained her merchandise, and began
walking erect and straight down the narrow rocky stairs
that led into the gorge, holding her distaff with its white
flax in her hands, and stepping as easily as if she bore no
burden.</p>

<p>Agnes followed her with light, irregular movements,
glancing aside from time to time, as a tuft of flowers or a
feathery spray of leaves attracted her fancy. In a few
moments her hands were too full, and her woolen apron of
many-colored stripes was raised over one arm to hold her
treasures, while a hymn to Saint Agnes, which she constantly
murmured to herself, came in little ripples of sound,
now from behind a rock, and now out of a tuft of bushes,
to show where the wanderer was hid. The song, like
many Italian ones, would be nothing in English,&mdash;only a
musical repetition of sweet words to a very simple and
childlike idea, the <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">bella</i>, <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">bella</i>, <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">bella</i> ringing out in every
verse with a tender joyousness that seemed in harmony
with the waving ferns and pendent flowers and long ivy-wreaths
from among which its notes issued. "Beautiful
and sweet Agnes," it said, in a thousand tender repetitions,
"make me like thy little white lamb! Beautiful Agnes,
take me to the green fields where Christ's lambs are feeding!
Sweeter than the rose, fairer than the lily, take me
where thou art!"</p>

<p>At the bottom of the ravine a little stream tinkles its
way among stones so mossy in their deep, cool shadow as
to appear all verdure; for seldom the light of the sun can
reach the darkness where they lie. A little bridge, hewn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
from solid rock, throws across the shrunken stream an arch
much wider than its waters seem to demand; for in spring
and autumn, when the torrents wash down from the mountains,
its volume is often suddenly increased.</p>

<p>This bridge was so entirely and evenly grown over with
short thick moss that it might seem cut of some strange
kind of living green velvet, and here and there it was
quaintly embroidered with small blossoming tufts of white
alyssum, or feathers of ferns and maiden's-hair which
shook and trembled to every breeze. Nothing could be
lovelier than this mossy bridge, when some stray sunbeam,
slanting up the gorge, took a fancy to light it up with
golden hues, and give transparent greenness to the tremulous
thin leaves that waved upon it.</p>

<p>On this spot Elsie paused a moment, and called back
after Agnes, who had disappeared into one of those deep
grottoes with which the sides of the gorge are perforated,
and which are almost entirely veiled by the pendent ivy-wreaths.</p>

<p>"Agnes! Agnes! wild girl! come quick!"</p>

<p>Only the sound of "<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Bella, bella Agnella</i>" came out of
the ivy-leaves to answer her; but it sounded so happy and
innocent that Elsie could not forbear a smile, and in a moment
Agnes came springing down with a quantity of the
feathery lycopodium in her hands, which grows nowhere
so well as in moist and dripping places.</p>

<p>Out of her apron were hanging festoons of golden broom,
crimson gladiolus, and long, trailing sprays of ivy; while
she held aloft in triumph a handful of the most superb
cyclamen, whose rosy crowns rise so beautifully above their
dark quaint leaves in moist and shady places.</p>

<p>"See, see, grandmother, what an offering I have! Saint
Agnes will be pleased with me to-day; for I believe in her
heart she loves flowers better than gems."</p>

<p>"Well, well, wild one,&mdash;time flies, we must hurry."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
And crossing the bridge quickly, the grandmother struck
into a mossy footpath that led them, after some walking,
under the old Roman bridge at the gateway of Sorrento.
Two hundred feet above their heads rose the mighty arches,
enameled with moss and feathered with ferns all the way;
and below this bridge the gorge grew somewhat wider, its
sides gradually receding and leaving a beautiful flat tract
of land, which was laid out as an orange-orchard. The
golden fruit was shut in by rocky walls on either side
which here formed a perfect hotbed, and no oranges were
earlier or finer.</p>

<p>Through this beautiful orchard the two at length emerged
from the gorge upon the sea-sands, where lay the blue
Mediterranean swathed in bands of morning mist, its many-colored
waters shimmering with a thousand reflected lights,
and old Capri panting through sultry blue mists, and Vesuvius
with his cloud-spotted sides and smoke-wreathed top
burst into view. At a little distance a boat-load of bronzed
fishermen had just drawn in a net, from which they were
throwing out a quantity of sardines, which flapped and
fluttered in the sunshine like scales of silver. The wind
blowing freshly bore thousands of little purple waves to
break one after another at the foamy line which lay on the
sand.</p>

<p>Agnes ran gayly along the beach with her flowers and
vines fluttering from her gay striped apron, and her cheeks
flushed with exercise and pleasure,&mdash;sometimes stopping
and turning with animation to her grandmother to point
out the various floral treasures that enameled every crevice
and rift of the steep wall of rock which rose perpendicularly
above their heads in that whole line of the shore
which is crowned with the old city of Sorrento: and surely
never did rocky wall show to the open sea a face more picturesque
and flowery. The deep red cliff was hollowed
here and there into fanciful grottoes, draped with every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
varied hue and form of vegetable beauty. Here a crevice
high in air was all abloom with purple gillyflower, and
depending in festoons above it the golden blossoms of the
broom; here a cleft seemed to be a nestling-place for a colony
of gladiolus, with its crimson flowers and blade-like
leaves; here the silver-frosted foliage of the miller-geranium,
or of the wormwood, toned down the extravagant
brightness of other blooms by its cooler tints. In some
places it seemed as if a sort of floral cascade were tumbling
confusedly over the rocks, mingling all hues and all forms
in a tangled mass of beauty.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said old Elsie, as Agnes pointed to some
superb gillyflowers which grew nearly half-way up the
precipice, "is the child possessed? You have all the gorge
in your apron already. Stop looking, and let us hurry on."</p>

<p>After a half-hour's walk, they came to a winding staircase
cut in the rock, which led them a zigzag course up
through galleries and grottoes looking out through curious
windows and loop-holes upon the sea, till finally they
emerged at the old sculptured portal of a shady garden
which was surrounded by the cloistered arcades of the Convent
of Saint Agnes.</p>

<p>The Convent of Saint Agnes was one of those monuments
in which the piety of the Middle Ages delighted to
commemorate the triumphs of the new Christianity over
the old Heathenism.</p>

<p>The balmy climate and paradisiacal charms of Sorrento
and the adjacent shores of Naples had made them favorite
resorts during the latter period of the Roman Empire,&mdash;a
period when the whole civilized world seemed to human
view about to be dissolved in the corruption of universal
sensuality. The shores of Baiæ were witnesses of the orgies
and cruelties of Nero and a court made in his likeness, and
the palpitating loveliness of Capri became the hotbed of
the unnatural vices of Tiberius. The whole of Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Italy was sunk in a debasement of animalism and ferocity
which seemed irrecoverable, and would have been so, had
it not been for the handful of salt which a Galilean peasant
had about that time cast into the putrid, fermenting mass
of human society.</p>

<p>We must not wonder at the zeal which caused the artistic
Italian nature to love to celebrate the passing away
of an era of unnatural vice and demoniac cruelty by visible
images of the purity, the tenderness, the universal benevolence
which Jesus had brought into the world.</p>

<p>Sometime about the middle of the thirteenth century, it
had been a favorite enterprise of a princess of a royal family
in Naples to erect a convent to Saint Agnes, the guardian
of female purity, out of the wrecks and remains of an ancient
temple of Venus, whose white pillars and graceful
acanthus-leaves once crowned a portion of the precipice on
which the town was built, and were reflected from the
glassy blue of the sea at its feet. It was said that this
princess was the first lady abbess. Be that as it may, it
proved to be a favorite retreat for many ladies of rank and
religious aspiration, whom ill-fortune in some of its varying
forms led to seek its quiet shades, and it was well and
richly endowed by its royal patrons.</p>

<p>It was built after the manner of conventual buildings
generally,&mdash;in a hollow square, with a cloistered walk
around the inside looking upon a garden.</p>

<p>The portal at which Agnes and her grandmother knocked,
after ascending the winding staircase cut in the precipice,
opened through an arched passage into this garden.</p>

<p>As the ponderous door swung open, it was pleasant to
hear the lulling sound of a fountain, which came forth
with a gentle patter, like that of soft summer rain, and to
see the waving of rose-bushes and golden jessamines, and
smell the perfumes of orange-blossoms mingling with those
of a thousand other flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
The door was opened by an odd-looking portress. She
might be seventy-five or eighty; her cheeks were of the
color of very yellow parchment drawn in dry wrinkles; her
eyes were those large, dark, lustrous ones so common in
her country, but seemed, in the general decay and shrinking
of every other part of her face, to have acquired a
wild, unnatural appearance; while the falling away of her
teeth left nothing to impede the meeting of her hooked
nose with her chin. Add to this, she was humpbacked,
and twisted in her figure; and one needs all the force of
her very good-natured, kindly smile to redeem the image
of poor old Jocunda from association with that of some
Thracian witch, and cause one to see in her the appropriate
portress of a Christian institution.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Agnes fell upon her neck and imprinted a
very fervent kiss upon what was left of her withered cheek,
and was repaid by a shower of those epithets of endearment
which in the language of Italy fly thick and fast as the
petals of the orange blossom from her groves.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said old Elsie, "I'm going to leave her
here to-day. You've no objections, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Bless the sweet lamb, no! She belongs here of good
right. I believe blessed Saint Agnes has adopted her; for
I've seen her smile, plain as could be, when the little one
brought her flowers."</p>

<p>"Well, Agnes," said the old woman, "I shall come for
you after the Ave Maria." Saying which, she lifted her
basket and departed.</p>

<p>The garden where the two were left was one of the most
peaceful retreats that the imagination of a poet could create.</p>

<p>Around it ran on all sides the Byzantine arches of a
cloistered walk, which, according to the quaint, rich fashion
of that style, had been painted with vermilion, blue,
and gold. The vaulted roof was spangled with gold stars
on a blue ground, and along the sides was a series of fresco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
pictures representing the various scenes in the life of Saint
Agnes; and as the foundress of the Convent was royal in
her means, there was no lack either of gold or gems or of
gorgeous painting.</p>

<p>Full justice was done in the first picture to the princely
wealth and estate of the fair Agnes, who was represented
as a pure-looking, pensive child, standing in a thoughtful
attitude, with long ripples of golden hair flowing down
over a simple white tunic, and her small hands clasping a
cross on her bosom, while, kneeling at her feet, obsequious
slaves and tire-women were offering the richest gems and
the most gorgeous robes to her serious and abstracted gaze.</p>

<p>In another, she was represented as walking modestly to
school, and winning the admiration of the son of the Roman
Prætor, who fell sick&mdash;so says the legend&mdash;for the
love of her.</p>

<p>Then there was the demand of her hand in marriage by
the princely father of the young man, and her calm rejection
of the gorgeous gifts and splendid gems which he had
brought to purchase her consent.</p>

<p>Then followed in order her accusation before the tribunals
as a Christian, her trial, and the various scenes of her
martyrdom.</p>

<p>Although the drawing of the figures and the treatment
of the subjects had the quaint stiffness of the thirteenth
century, their general effect, as seen from the shady bowers
of the garden, was of a solemn brightness, a strange and
fanciful richness, which was poetical and impressive.</p>

<p>In the centre of the garden was a fountain of white
marble, which evidently was the wreck of something that
had belonged to the old Greek temple. The statue of a
nymph sat on a green mossy pedestal in the midst of a
sculptured basin, and from a partially reversed urn on
which she was leaning, a clear stream of water dashed down
from one mossy fragment to another, till it lost itself in
the placid pool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
The figure and face of this nymph, in their classic finish
of outline, formed a striking contrast to the drawing of the
Byzantine paintings within the cloisters, and their juxtaposition
in the same enclosure seemed a presentation of the
spirit of a past and present era: the past so graceful in
line, so perfect and airy in conception, so utterly without
spiritual aspiration or life; the present limited in artistic
power, but so earnest, so intense, seeming to struggle and
burn, amid its stiff and restricted boundaries, for the expression
of some diviner phase of humanity.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the nymph of the fountain, different in
style and execution as it was, was so fair a creature, that it
was thought best, after the spirit of those days, to purge
her from all heathen and improper histories by baptizing
her in the waters of her own fountain, and bestowing on
her the name of the saint to whose convent she was devoted.
The simple sisterhood, little conversant in nice
points of antiquity, regarded her as Saint Agnes dispensing
the waters of purity to her convent; and marvelous and
sacred properties were ascribed to the water, when taken
fasting with a sufficient number of prayers and other religious
exercises. All around the neighborhood of this fountain
the ground was one bed of blue and white violets,
whose fragrance filled the air, and which were deemed by
the nuns to have come up there in especial token of the
favor with which Saint Agnes regarded the conversion of
this heathen relic to pious and Christian uses.</p>

<p>This nymph had been an especial favorite of the childhood
of Agnes, and she had always had a pleasure which
she could not exactly account for in gazing upon it. It is
seldom that one sees in the antique conception of the immortals
any trace of human feeling. Passionless perfection
and repose seem to be their uniform character. But now
and then from the ruins of Southern Italy fragments have
been dug, not only pure in outline, but invested with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
strange pathetic charm, as if the calm, inviolable circle of
divinity had been touched by some sorrowing sense of that
unexplained anguish with which the whole lower creation
groans. One sees this mystery of expression in the face
of that strange and beautiful Psyche which still enchants
the Museum of Naples. Something of this charm of mournful
pathos lingered on the beautiful features of this nymph,&mdash;an
expression so delicate and shadowy that it seemed to
address itself only to finer natures. It was as if all the
silent, patient woe and discouragement of a dumb antiquity
had been congealed into this memorial. Agnes was often
conscious, when a child, of being saddened by it, and yet
drawn towards it with a mysterious attraction.</p>

<p>About this fountain, under the shadow of bending rose
trees and yellow jessamines, was a circle of garden seats,
adopted also from the ruins of the past. Here a graceful
Corinthian capital, with every white acanthus-leaf perfect,
stood in a mat of acanthus-leaves of Nature's own making,
glossy green and sharply cut; and there was a long portion
of a frieze sculptured with graceful dancing figures; and in
another place a fragment of a fluted column, with lycopodium
and colosseum vine hanging from its fissures in graceful
draping. On these seats Agnes had dreamed away
many a tranquil hour, making garlands of violets, and listening
to the marvelous legends of old Jocunda.</p>

<p>In order to understand anything of the true idea of conventual
life in those days, we must consider that books
were as yet unknown, except as literary rarities, and reading
and writing were among the rare accomplishments of
the higher classes; and that Italy, from the time that the
great Roman Empire fell and broke into a thousand shivers,
had been subject to a continual series of conflicts and struggles,
which took from life all security. Norman, Dane,
Sicilian, Spaniard, Frenchman, and German mingled and
struggled, now up and now down; and every struggle was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
attended by the little ceremonies of sacking towns, burning
villages, and routing out entire populations to utter misery
and wretchedness. During these tumultuous ages, those
buildings consecrated by a religion recognized alike by all
parties afforded to misfortune the only inviolable asylum,
and to feeble and discouraged spirits the only home safe
from the prospect of reverses.</p>

<p>If the destiny of woman is a problem that calls for grave
attention even in our enlightened times, and if she is too
often a sufferer from the inevitable movements of society,
what must have been her position and needs in those ruder
ages, unless the genius of Christianity had opened refuges
for her weakness, made inviolable by the awful sanctions
of religion?</p>

<p>What could they do, all these girls and women together,
with the twenty-four long hours of every day, without
reading or writing, and without the care of children?
Enough; with their multiplied diurnal prayer periods,
with each its chants and ritual of observances,&mdash;with the
preparation for meals, and the clearing away thereafter,&mdash;with
the care of the chapel, shrine, sacred gifts, drapery,
and ornaments,&mdash;with embroidering altar-cloths and making
sacred tapers,&mdash;with preparing conserves of rose leaves
and curious spiceries,&mdash;with mixing drugs for the sick,&mdash;with
all those mutual offices and services to each other
which their relations in one family gave rise to,&mdash;and
with divers feminine gossipries and harmless chatterings
and cooings, one can conceive that these dove-cots of the
Church presented often some of the most tranquil scenes of
those convulsive and disturbed periods.</p>

<p>Human nature probably had its varieties there as otherwhere.
There were there the domineering and the weak,
the ignorant and the vulgar, and the patrician and the
princess, and though professedly all brought on the footing
of sisterly equality, we are not to suppose any Utopian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
degree of perfection among them. The way of pure spirituality
was probably, in the convent as well as out, that
strait and narrow one which there be few to find. There,
as elsewhere, the devotee who sought to progress faster
toward heaven than suited the paces of her fellow-travelers
was reckoned a troublesome enthusiast, till she got far
enough in advance to be worshiped as a saint.</p>

<p>Sister Theresa, the abbess of this convent, was the
youngest daughter in a princely Neapolitan family, who
from her cradle had been destined to the cloister, in order
that her brother and sister might inherit more splendid
fortunes and form more splendid connections. She had
been sent to this place too early to have much recollection
of any other mode of life; and when the time came to take
the irrevocable step, she renounced with composure a world
she had never known.</p>

<p>Her brother had endowed her with a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">livre des heures</i>,
illuminated with all the wealth of blue and gold and divers
colors which the art of those times afforded,&mdash;a work executed
by a pupil of the celebrated Fra Angelico; and the
possession of this treasure was regarded by her as a far
richer inheritance than that princely state of which she
knew nothing. Her neat little cell had a window that
looked down on the sea,&mdash;on Capri, with its fantastic
grottoes,&mdash;on Vesuvius, with its weird daily and nightly
changes. The light that came in from the joint reflection
of sea and sky gave a golden and picturesque coloring to
the simple and bare furniture, and in sunny weather she
often sat there, just as a lizard lies upon a wall, with the
simple, warm, delightful sense of living and being amid
scenes of so much beauty. Of the life that people lived in
the outer world, the struggle, the hope, the fear, the vivid
joy, the bitter sorrow, Sister Theresa knew nothing. She
could form no judgment and give no advice founded on
any such experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
The only life she knew was a certain ideal one, drawn
from the legends of the saints; and her piety was a calm,
pure enthusiasm which had never been disturbed by a
temptation or a struggle. Her rule in the Convent was
even and serene; but those who came to her flock from the
real world, from the trials and temptations of a real experience,
were always enigmas to her, and she could scarcely
comprehend or aid them.</p>

<p>In fact, since in the cloister, as everywhere else, character
will find its level, it was old Jocunda who was the real
governess of the Convent. Jocunda was originally a peasant
woman, whose husband had been drafted to some of
the wars of his betters, and she had followed his fortunes
in the camp. In the sack of a fortress, she lost her husband
and four sons, all the children she had, and herself received
an injury which distorted her form, and so she took refuge
in the Convent. Here her energy and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">savoir-faire</i> rendered
her indispensable in every department. She made the bargains,
bought the provisions (being allowed to sally forth
for these purposes), and formed the medium by which the
timid, abstract, defenseless nuns accomplished those material
relations with the world with which the utmost saintliness
cannot afford to dispense. Besides and above all this,
Jocunda's wide experience and endless capabilities of narrative
made her an invaluable resource for enlivening any
dull hours that might be upon the hands of the sisterhood;
and all these recommendations, together with a strong
mother-wit and native sense, soon made her so much the
leading spirit in the Convent that Mother Theresa herself
might be said to be under her dominion.</p>

<p>"So, so," she said to Agnes, when she had closed the
gate after Elsie,&mdash;"you never come empty-handed. What
lovely oranges!&mdash;worth double any that one can buy of
anybody else but your grandmother."</p>

<p>"Yes, and these flowers I brought to dress the altar."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
"Ah, yes! Saint Agnes has given you a particular
grace for that," said Jocunda.</p>

<p>"And I have brought a ring for her treasury," said Agnes,
taking out the gift of the Cavalier.</p>

<p>"Holy Mother! here is something, to be sure!" said
Jocunda, catching it eagerly. "Why, Agnes, this is a
diamond,&mdash;and as pretty a one as ever I saw. How it
shines!" she added, holding it up. "That's a prince's
present. How did you get it?"</p>

<p>"I want to tell our mother about it," said Agnes.</p>

<p>"You do?" said Jocunda. "You'd better tell me. I
know fifty times as much about such things as she."</p>

<p>"Dear Jocunda, I will tell you, too; but I love Mother
Theresa, and I ought to give it to her first."</p>

<p>"As you please, then," said Jocunda. "Well, put
your flowers here by the fountain, where the spray will
keep them cool, and we will go to her."</p>

<span class="smaller">THE DAY AT THE CONVENT</span></h2>

<p>The Mother Theresa sat in a sort of withdrawing-room,
the roof of which rose in arches, starred with blue and
gold like that of the cloister, and the sides were frescoed
with scenes from the life of the Virgin. Over every door,
and in convenient places between the paintings, texts of
Holy Writ were illuminated in blue and scarlet and gold,
with a richness and fancifulness of outline, as if every
sacred letter had blossomed into a mystical flower. The
Abbess herself, with two of her nuns, was busily embroidering
a new altar-cloth, with a lavish profusion of adornment;
and, from time to time, their voices rose in the
musical tones of an ancient Latin hymn. The words were
full of that quaint and mystical pietism with which the
fashion of the times clothed the expression of devotional
<span class="locked">feeling:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>This little canticle was, in truth, very different from the
hymns to Venus which used to resound in the temple which
the convent had displaced. The voices which sung were
of a deep, plaintive contralto, much resembling the richness
of a tenor, and as they moved in modulated waves of chanting
sound, the effect was soothing and dreamy. Agnes
stopped at the door to listen.</p>

<p>"Stop, dear Jocunda," she said to the old woman, who
was about to push her way abruptly into the room, "wait
till it is over."</p>

<p>Jocunda, who was quite matter-of-fact in her ideas of
religion, made a little movement of impatience, but was
recalled to herself by observing the devout absorption with
which Agnes, with clasped hands and downcast head, was
mentally joining in the hymn with a solemn brightness in
her young face.</p>

<p>"If she hasn't got a vocation, nobody ever had one,"
said Jocunda, mentally. "Deary me, I wish I had more
of one myself!"</p>

<p>When the strain died away, and was succeeded by a
conversation on the respective merits of two kinds of gold
embroidering thread, Agnes and Jocunda entered the apartment.
Agnes went forward and kissed the hand of the
Mother reverentially.</p>

<p>Sister Theresa we have before described as tall, pale,
and sad-eyed,&mdash;a moonlight style of person, wanting in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
all those elements of warm color and physical solidity
which give the impression of a real vital human existence.
The strongest affection she had ever known had been that
which had been excited by the childish beauty and graces
of Agnes, and she folded her in her arms and kissed her
forehead with a warmth that had in it the semblance of
maternity.</p>

<p>"Grandmamma has given me a day to spend with you,
dear mother," said Agnes.</p>

<p>"Welcome, dear little child!" said Mother Theresa.
"Your spiritual home always stands open to you."</p>

<p>"I have something to speak to you of in particular, my
mother," said Agnes, blushing deeply.</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said the Mother Theresa, a slight movement
of curiosity arising in her mind as she signed to the two
nuns to leave the apartment.</p>

<p>"My mother," said Agnes, "yesterday evening, as grandmamma
and I were sitting at the gate, selling oranges, a
young cavalier came up and bought oranges of me, and he
kissed my forehead and asked me to pray for him, and gave
me this ring for the shrine of Saint Agnes."</p>

<p>"Kissed your forehead!" said Jocunda, "here's a
pretty go! it isn't like you, Agnes, to let him."</p>

<p>"He did it before I knew," said Agnes. "Grandmamma
reproved him, and then he seemed to repent, and
gave this ring for the shrine of Saint Agnes."</p>

<p>"And a pretty one it is, too," said Jocunda. "We
haven't a prettier in all our treasury. Not even the great
emerald the Queen gave is better in its way than this."</p>

<p>"And he asked you to pray for him?" said Mother
Theresa.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother dear; he looked right into my eyes and
made me look into his, and made me promise; and I knew
that holy virgins never refused their prayers to any one
that asked, and so I followed their example."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
"I'll warrant me he was only mocking at you for a poor
little fool," said Jocunda; "the gallants of our day don't
believe much in prayers."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, Jocunda," said Agnes, gravely; "but if
that be the case, he needs prayers all the more."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mother Theresa. "Remember the story of
the blessed Saint Dorothea,&mdash;how a wicked young nobleman
mocked at her, when she was going to execution, and
said, 'Dorothea, Dorothea, I will believe, when you shall
send me down some of the fruits and flowers of Paradise;'
and she, full of faith, said, 'To-day I will send them;'
and, wonderful to tell, that very day, at evening, an angel
came to the young man with a basket of citrons and roses,
and said, 'Dorothea sends thee these, wherefore believe.'
See what grace a pure maiden can bring to a thoughtless
young man,&mdash;for this young man was converted and became
a champion of the faith."</p>

<p>"That was in the old times," said Jocunda, skeptically.
"I don't believe setting the lamb to pray for the wolf will
do much in our day. Prithee, child, what manner of man
was this gallant?"</p>

<p>"He was beautiful as an angel," said Agnes, "only it
was not a good beauty. He looked proud and sad, both,&mdash;like
one who is not at ease in his heart. Indeed, I
feel very sorry for him; his eyes made a kind of trouble
in my mind that reminds me to pray for him often."</p>

<p>"And I will join my prayers to yours, dear daughter,"
said the Mother Theresa; "I long to have you with us,
that we may pray together every day; say, do you think
your grandmamma will spare you to us wholly before
long?"</p>

<p>"Grandmamma will not hear of it yet," said Agnes;
"and she loves me so, it would break her heart, if I should
leave her, and she could not be happy here; but, mother,
you have told me we could carry an altar always in our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
hearts, and adore in secret. When it is God's will I
should come to you, He will incline her heart."</p>

<p>"Between you and me, little one," said Jocunda, "I
think there will soon be a third person who will have
something to say in the case."</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean?" said Agnes.</p>

<p>"A husband," said Jocunda; "I suppose your grandmother
has one picked out for you. You are neither
humpbacked nor cross-eyed, that you shouldn't have one
as well as other girls."</p>

<p>"I don't want one, Jocunda; and I have promised to
Saint Agnes to come here, if she will only get grandmother
to consent."</p>

<p>"Bless you, my daughter!" said Mother Theresa; "only
persevere and the way will be opened."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Jocunda, "we'll see. Come, little
one, if you wouldn't have your flowers wilt, we must go
back and look after them."</p>

<p>Reverently kissing the hand of the Abbess, Agnes withdrew
with her old friend, and crossed again to the garden
to attend to her flowers.</p>

<p>"Well now, childie," said Jocunda, "you can sit here
and weave your garlands, while I go and look after the
conserves of raisins and citrons that Sister Cattarina is
making. She is stupid at anything but her prayers, is
Cattarina. Our Lady be gracious to me! I think I got
my vocation from Saint Martha, and if it wasn't for me, I
don't know what would become of things in the Convent.
Why, since I came here, our conserves, done up in fig-leaf
packages, have had quite a run at Court, and our gracious
Queen herself was good enough to send an order for a hundred
of them last week. I could have laughed to see how
puzzled the Mother Theresa looked; much she knows
about conserves! I suppose she thinks Gabriel brings
them straight down from Paradise, done up in leaves of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
the tree of life. Old Jocunda knows what goes to their
making up; she's good for something, if she is old and
twisted; many a scrubby old olive bears fat berries," said
the old portress, chuckling.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear Jocunda," said Agnes, "why must you go this
minute? I want to talk with you about so many things!"</p>

<p>"Bless the sweet child! it does want its old Jocunda,
does it?" said the old woman, in the tone with which one
caresses a baby. "Well, well, it should then! Just wait
a minute, till I go and see that our holy Saint Cattarina
hasn't fallen a-praying over the conserving-pan. I'll be
back in a moment."</p>

<p>So saying, she hobbled off briskly, and Agnes, sitting
down on the fragment sculptured with dancing nymphs,
began abstractedly pulling her flowers towards her, shaking
from them the dew of the fountain.</p>

<p>Unconsciously to herself, as she sat there, her head
drooped into the attitude of the marble nymph, and her
sweet features assumed the same expression of plaintive and
dreamy thoughtfulness; her heavy dark lashes lay on her
pure waxen cheeks like the dark fringe of some tropical
flower. Her form, in its drooping outlines, scarcely yet
showed the full development of womanhood, which after-years
might unfold into the ripe fullness of her country-women.
Her whole attitude and manner were those of
an exquisitely sensitive and highly organized being, just
struggling into the life of some mysterious new inner birth,&mdash;into
the sense of powers of feeling and being hitherto
unknown even to herself.</p>

<p>"Ah," she softly sighed to herself, "how little I am!
how little I can do! Could I convert one soul! Ah, holy
Dorothea, send down the roses of heaven into his soul,
that he also may believe!"</p>

<p>"Well, my little beauty, you have not finished even one
garland," said the voice of old Jocunda, bustling up behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
her. "Praise to Saint Martha, the conserves are doing
well, and so I catch a minute for my little heart."</p>

<p>So saying, she sat down with her spindle and flax by
Agnes, for an afternoon gossip.</p>

<p>"Dear Jocunda, I have heard you tell stories about
spirits that haunt lonesome places. Did you ever hear
about any in the gorge?"</p>

<p>"Why, bless the child, yes,&mdash;spirits are always pacing
up and down in lonely places. Father Anselmo told me
that; and he had seen a priest once that had seen that in
the Holy Scriptures themselves,&mdash;so it must be true."</p>

<p>"Well, did you ever hear of their making the most beautiful
music?"</p>

<p>"Haven't I?" said Jocunda,&mdash;"to be sure I have,&mdash;singing
enough to draw the very heart out of your body,&mdash;it's
an old trick they have. Why, I want to know if
you never heard about the King of Amalfi's son coming
home from fighting for the Holy Sepulchre? Why, there's
rocks not far out from this very town where the Sirens
live; and if the King's son hadn't had a holy bishop on
board, who slept every night with a piece of the true cross
under his pillow, the green ladies would have sung him
straight into perdition. They are very fair-spoken at first,
and sing so that a man gets perfectly drunk with their
music, and longs to fly to them; but they suck him down
at last under water, and strangle him, and that's the end
of him."</p>

<p>"You never told me about this before, Jocunda."</p>

<p>"Haven't I, child? Well, I will now. You see, this
good bishop, he dreamed three times that they would sail
past these rocks, and he was told to give all the sailors
holy wax from an altar-candle to stop their ears, so that
they shouldn't hear the music. Well, the King's son said
he wanted to hear the music, so he wouldn't have his ears
stopped; but he told 'em to tie him to the mast, so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
he could hear it, but not to mind a word he said, if he
begged 'em ever so hard to untie him.</p>

<p>"Well, you see they did it; and the old bishop, he had
his ears sealed up tight, and so did all the men; but the
young man stood tied to the mast, and when they sailed
past he was like a demented creature. He called out that
it was his lady who was singing, and he wanted to go to
her,&mdash;and his mother, who they all knew was a blessed
saint in paradise years before; and he commanded them to
untie him, and pulled and strained on his cords to get free;
but they only tied him the tighter, and so they got him
past,&mdash;for, thanks to the holy wax, the sailors never heard
a word, and so they kept their senses. So they all got
safe home; but the young prince was so sick and pining
that he had to be exorcised and prayed for seven times
seven days before they could get the music out of his
head."</p>

<p>"Why," said Agnes, "do those Sirens sing there yet?"</p>

<p>"Well, that was a hundred years ago. They say the
old bishop, he prayed 'em down; for he went out a little
after on purpose, and gave 'em a precious lot of holy water;
most likely he got 'em pretty well under, though my husband's
brother says he's heard 'em singing in a small way,
like frogs in springtime; but he gave 'em a pretty wide
berth. You see, these spirits are what's left of old heathen
times, when, Lord bless us! the earth was just as full of
'em as a bit of old cheese is of mites. Now a Christian
body, if they take reasonable care, can walk quit of 'em;
and if they have any haunts in lonesome and doleful places,
if one puts up a cross or a shrine, they know they have to
go."</p>

<p>"I am thinking," said Agnes, "it would be a blessed
work to put up some shrines to Saint Agnes and our good
Lord in the gorge, and I'll promise to keep the lamps
burning and the flowers in order."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
"Bless the child!" said Jocunda, "that is a pious and
Christian thought."</p>

<p>"I have an uncle in Florence who is a father in the holy
convent of San Marco, who paints and works in stone,&mdash;not
for money, but for the glory of God; and when he
comes this way I will speak to him about it," said Agnes.
"About this time in the spring he always visits us."</p>

<p>"That's mighty well thought of," said Jocunda. "And
now, tell me, little lamb, have you any idea who this grand
cavalier may be that gave you the ring?"</p>

<p>"No," said Agnes, pausing a moment over the garland
of flowers she was weaving,&mdash;"only Giulietta told me that
he was brother to the King. Giulietta said everybody
knew him."</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that," said Jocunda. "Giulietta
always thinks she knows more than she does."</p>

<p>"Whatever he may be, his worldly state is nothing to
me," said Agnes. "I know him only in my prayers."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay," muttered the old woman to herself, looking
obliquely out of the corner of her eye at the girl, who was
busily sorting her flowers; "perhaps he will be seeking
some other acquaintance."</p>

<p>"You haven't seen him since?" said Jocunda.</p>

<p>"Seen him? Why, dear Jocunda, it was only last <span class="locked">evening"&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"True enough. Well, child, don't think too much of
him. Men are dreadful creatures,&mdash;in these times especially;
they snap up a pretty girl as a fox does a chicken,
and no questions asked."</p>

<p>"I don't think he looked wicked, Jocunda; he had a
proud, sorrowful look. I don't know what could make a
rich, handsome young man sorrowful; but I feel in my
heart that he is not happy. Mother Theresa says that
those who can do nothing but pray may convert princes
without knowing it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
"Maybe it is so," said Jocunda, in the same tone in
which thrifty professors of religion often assent to the same
sort of truths in our days. "I've seen a good deal of that
sort of cattle in my day; and one would think, by their
actions, that praying souls must be scarce where they came
from."</p>

<p>Agnes abstractedly stooped and began plucking handfuls
of lycopodium, which was growing green and feathery on
one side of the marble frieze on which she was sitting; in
so doing, a fragment of white marble, which had been overgrown
in the luxuriant green, appeared to view. It was
that frequent object in the Italian soil,&mdash;a portion of an
old Roman tombstone. Agnes bent over, intent on the
mystic "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dis Manibus</i>," in old Roman letters.</p>

<p>"Lord bless the child! I've seen thousands of them,"
said Jocunda; "it's some old heathen's grave, that's been
in hell these hundred years."</p>

<p>"In hell?" said Agnes, with a distressful accent.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Jocunda. "Where should they be?
Serves 'em right, too; they were a vile old set."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jocunda, it's dreadful to think of, that they
should have been in hell all this time."</p>

<p>"And no nearer the end than when they began," said
Jocunda.</p>

<p>Agnes gave a shivering sigh, and, looking up into the
golden sky that was pouring such floods of splendor through
the orange trees and jasmines, thought, How could it be
that the world could possibly be going on so sweet and fair
over such an abyss?</p>

<p>"Oh, Jocunda!" she said, "it does seem too dreadful
to believe! How could they help being heathen,&mdash;being
born so,&mdash;and never hearing of the true Church?"</p>

<p>"Sure enough," said Jocunda, spinning away energetically,
"but that's no business of mine; my business is to
save <i>my</i> soul, and that's what I came here for. The dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
saints know I found it dull enough at first, for I'd been
used to jaunting round with my old man and the boy; but
what with marketing and preserving, and one thing and
another, I get on better now, praise to Saint Agnes!"</p>

<p>The large, dark eyes of Agnes were fixed abstractedly on
the old woman as she spoke, slowly dilating, with a sad,
mysterious expression, which sometimes came over them.</p>

<p>"Ah! how can the saints themselves be happy?" she
said. "One might be willing to wear sackcloth and sleep
on the ground, one might suffer ever so many years and
years, if only one might save some of them."</p>

<p>"Well, it does seem hard," said Jocunda; "but what's
the use of thinking of it? Old Father Anselmo told us in
one of his sermons that the Lord wills that his saints
should come to rejoice in the punishment of all heathens
and heretics; and he told us about a great saint once, who
took it into his head to be distressed because one of the
old heathen whose books he was fond of reading had gone
to hell,&mdash;and he fasted and prayed, and wouldn't take no
for an answer, till he got him out."</p>

<p>"He did, then?" said Agnes, clasping her hands in an
ecstasy.</p>

<p>"Yes; but the good Lord told him never to try it again,&mdash;and
He struck him dumb, as a kind of hint, you know.
Why, Father Anselmo said that even getting souls out of
purgatory was no easy matter. He told us of one holy nun
who spent nine years fasting and praying for the soul of
her prince, who was killed in a duel, and then she saw in
a vision that he was only raised the least little bit out of
the fire,&mdash;and she offered up her life as a sacrifice to the
Lord to deliver him, but, after all, when she died he
wasn't quite delivered. Such things made me think that
a poor old sinner like me would never get out at all, if I
didn't set about it in earnest,&mdash;though it ain't all nuns
that save their souls either. I remember in Pisa I saw a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
great picture of the Judgment Day in the Campo Santo,
and there were lots of abbesses, and nuns, and monks,
and bishops, too, that the devils were clearing off into the
fire."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jocunda, how dreadful that fire must be!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Jocunda. "Father Anselmo said hell-fire
wasn't like any kind of fire we have here,&mdash;made to
warm us and cook our food,&mdash;but a kind made especially
to torment body and soul, and not made for anything else.
I remember a story he told us about that. You see, there
was an old duchess that lived in a grand old castle,&mdash;and
a proud, wicked old thing enough; and her son brought
home a handsome young bride to the castle, and the old
duchess was jealous of her,&mdash;'cause, you see, she hated to
give up her place in the house, and the old family jewels,
and all the splendid things,&mdash;and so one time, when the
poor young thing was all dressed up in a set of the old
family lace, what does the old hag do but set fire to it!"</p>

<p>"How horrible!" said Agnes.</p>

<p>"Yes; and when the young thing ran screaming in her
agony, the old hag stopped her and tore off a pearl rosary
that she was wearing, for fear it should be spoiled by the
fire."</p>

<p>"Holy Mother! can such things be possible?" said
Agnes.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, she got her pay for it. That rosary
was of famous old pearls that had been in the family a
hundred years; but from that moment the good Lord struck
it with a curse, and filled it white-hot with hell-fire, so
that if anybody held it a few minutes in their hand, it
would burn to the bone. The old sinner made believe that
she was in great affliction for the death of her daughter-in-law,
and that it was all an accident, and the poor young
man went raving mad,&mdash;but that awful rosary the old hag
couldn't get rid of. She couldn't give it away,&mdash;she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
couldn't sell it,&mdash;but back it would come every night,
and lie right over her heart, all white-hot with the fire
that burned in it. She gave it to a convent, and she sold
it to a merchant, but back it came; and she locked it up
in the heaviest chests, and she buried it down in the lowest
vaults, but it always came back in the night, till she
was worn to a skeleton; and at last the old thing died
without confession or sacrament, and went where she belonged.
She was found lying dead in her bed one morning,
and the rosary was gone; but when they came to lay
her out, they found the marks of it burned to the bone
into her breast. Father Anselmo used to tell us this, to
show us a little what hell-fire was like."</p>

<p>"Oh, please, Jocunda, don't let us talk about it any
more," said Agnes.</p>

<p>Old Jocunda, with her tough, vigorous organization and
unceremonious habits of expression, could not conceive the
exquisite pain with which this whole conversation had
vibrated on the sensitive being at her right hand,&mdash;that
what merely awoke her hard-corded nerves to a dull vibration
of not unpleasant excitement was shivering and tearing
the tenderer chords of poor little Psyche beside her.</p>

<p>Ages before, beneath those very skies that smiled so
sweetly over her,&mdash;amid the bloom of lemon and citron,
and the perfume of jasmine and rose, the gentlest of old
Italian souls had dreamed and wondered what might be the
unknown future of the dead, and, learning his lesson from
the glorious skies and gorgeous shores which witnessed
how magnificent a Being had given existence to man, had
recorded his hopes of man's future in the words&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Aut
beatus, aut nihil</i>; but, singular to tell, the religion which
brought with it all human tenderness and pities,&mdash;the
hospital for the sick, the refuge for the orphan, the enfranchisement
of the slave,&mdash;this religion brought also the
news of the eternal, hopeless, living torture of the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
majority of mankind, past and present. Tender spirits,
like those of Dante, carried this awful mystery as a secret
and unexplained anguish, saints wrestled with God and
wept over it; but still the awful fact remained, spite of
Church and sacrament, that the gospel was in effect, to the
majority of the human race, not the glad tidings of salvation,
but the sentence of unmitigable doom.</p>

<p>The present traveler in Italy sees with disgust the dim
and faded frescoes in which this doom is portrayed in all
its varied refinements of torture; and the vivid Italian
mind ran riot in these lurid fields, and every monk who
wanted to move his audience was in his small way a Dante.
The poet and the artist give only the highest form of the
ideas of their day, and he who cannot read the "Inferno"
with firm nerves may ask what the same representations
were likely to have been in the grasp of coarse and common
minds.</p>

<p>The first teachers of Christianity in Italy read the Gospels
by the light of those fiendish fires which consumed
their fellows. Daily made familiar with the scorching, the
searing, the racking, the devilish ingenuities of torture,
they transferred them to the future hell of the torturers.
The sentiment within us which asserts eternal justice and
retribution was stimulated to a kind of madness by that
first baptism of fire and blood, and expanded the simple
and grave warnings of the gospel into a lurid poetry of
physical torture. Hence, while Christianity brought multiplied
forms of mercy into the world, it failed for many
centuries to humanize the savage forms of justice; and
rack and wheel, fire and fagot were the modes by which
human justice aspired to a faint imitation of what divine
justice was supposed to extend through eternity.</p>

<p>But it is remarkable always to observe the power of individual
minds to draw out of the popular religious ideas of
their country only those elements which suit themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
and to drop others from their thought. As a bee can
extract pure honey from the blossoms of some plants whose
leaves are poisonous, so some souls can nourish themselves
only with the holier and more ethereal parts of popular
belief.</p>

<p>Agnes had hitherto dwelt only on the cheering and the
joyous features of her faith; her mind loved to muse on
the legends of saints and angels and the glories of paradise,
which, with a secret buoyancy, she hoped to be the lot of
every one she saw. The mind of the Mother Theresa was
of the same elevated cast, and the terrors on which Jocunda
dwelt with such homely force of language seldom made a
part of her instructions.</p>

<p>Agnes tried to dismiss these gloomy images from her
mind, and, after arranging her garlands, went to decorate
the shrine and altar,&mdash;a cheerful labor of love, in which
she delighted.</p>

<p>To the mind of the really spiritual Christian of those
ages the air of this lower world was not as it is to us, in
spite of our nominal faith in the Bible, a blank, empty
space from which all spiritual sympathy and life have fled,
but, like the atmosphere with which Raphael has surrounded
the Sistine Madonna, it was full of sympathizing
faces, a great "cloud of witnesses." The holy dead were
not gone from earth; the Church visible and invisible were
in close, loving, and constant sympathy,&mdash;still loving,
praying, and watching together, though with a veil between.</p>

<p>It was at first with no idolatrous intention that the
prayers of the holy dead were invoked in acts of worship.
Their prayers were asked simply because they were felt to
be as really present with their former friends and as truly
sympathetic as if no veil of silence had fallen between. In
time this simple belief had its intemperate and idolatrous
exaggerations,&mdash;the Italian soil always seeming to have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
fiery and volcanic forcing power, by which religious ideas
overblossomed themselves, and grew wild and ragged with
too much enthusiasm; and, as so often happens with
friends on earth, these too much loved and revered invisible
friends became eclipsing screens instead of transmitting
mediums of God's light to the soul.</p>

<p>Yet we can see in the hymns of Savonarola, who perfectly
represented the attitude of the highest Christian of
those times, how perfect might be the love and veneration
for departed saints without lapsing into idolatry, and with
what an atmosphere of warmth and glory the true belief of
the unity of the Church, visible and invisible, could inspire
an elevated soul amid the discouragements of an unbelieving
and gainsaying world.</p>

<p>Our little Agnes, therefore, when she had spread all her
garlands out, seemed really to feel as if the girlish figure
that smiled in sacred white from the altar-piece was a dear
friend who smiled upon her, and was watching to lead her
up the path to heaven.</p>

<p>Pleasantly passed the hours of that day to the girl, and
when at evening old Elsie called for her, she wondered that
the day had gone so fast.</p>

<p>Old Elsie returned with no inconsiderable triumph from
her stand. The cavalier had been several times during the
day past her stall, and once, stopping in a careless way
to buy fruit, commented on the absence of her young
charge. This gave Elsie the highest possible idea of her
own sagacity and shrewdness, and of the promptitude with
which she had taken her measures, so that she was in as
good spirits as people commonly are who think they have
performed some stroke of generalship.</p>

<p>As the old woman and young girl emerged from the
dark-vaulted passage that led them down through the rocks
on which the convent stood to the sea at its base, the light
of a most glorious sunset burst upon them, in all those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
strange and magical mysteries of light which any one who
has walked that beach of Sorrento at evening will never
forget.</p>

<p>Agnes ran along the shore, and amused herself with
picking up little morsels of red and black coral, and those
fragments of mosaic pavements, blue, red, and green, which
the sea is never tired of casting up from the thousands of
ancient temples and palaces which have gone to wreck all
around these shores.</p>

<p>As she was busy doing this, she suddenly heard the
voice of Giulietta behind her.</p>

<p>"So ho, Agnes! where have you been all day?"</p>

<p>"At the Convent," said Agnes, raising herself from her
work, and smiling at Giulietta, in her frank, open way.</p>

<p>"Oh, then you really did take the ring to Saint Agnes?"</p>

<p>"To be sure I did," said Agnes.</p>

<p>"Simple child!" said Giulietta, laughing; "that wasn't
what he meant you to do with it. He meant it for you,&mdash;only
your grandmother was by. You never will have
any lovers, if she keeps you so tight."</p>

<p>"I can do without," said Agnes.</p>

<p>"I could tell you something about this one," said Giulietta.</p>

<p>"You did tell me something yesterday," said Agnes.</p>

<p>"But I could tell you some more. I know he wants to
see you again."</p>

<p>"What for?" said Agnes.</p>

<p>"Simpleton, he's in love with you. You never had a
lover; it's time you had."</p>

<p>"I don't want one, Giulietta. I hope I never shall see
him again."</p>

<p>"Oh, nonsense, Agnes! Why, what a girl you are!
Why, before I was as old as you, I had half-a-dozen
lovers."</p>

<p>"Agnes," said the sharp voice of Elsie, coming up from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
behind, "don't run on ahead of me again; and you,
Mistress Baggage, let my child alone."</p>

<p>"Who's touching your child?" said Giulietta, scornfully.
"Can't a body say a civil word to her?"</p>

<p>"I know what you would be after," said Elsie, "filling
her head with talk of all the wild, loose gallants; but she
is for no such market, I promise you! Come, Agnes."</p>

<p>So saying, old Elsie drew Agnes rapidly along with her,
leaving Giulietta rolling her great black eyes after them
with an air of infinite contempt.</p>

<p>"The old kite!" she said; "I declare he shall get
speech of the little dove, if only to spite her. Let her try
her best, and see if we don't get round her before she
knows it. Pietro says his master is certainly wild after
her, and I have promised to help him."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, just as old Elsie and Agnes were turning
into the orange orchard which led into the Gorge of Sorrento,
they met the cavalier of the evening before.</p>

<p>He stopped, and, removing his cap, saluted them with
as much deference as if they had been princesses. Old
Elsie frowned, and Agnes blushed deeply; both hurried
forward. Looking back, the old woman saw that he was
walking slowly behind them, evidently watching them
closely, yet not in a way sufficiently obtrusive to warrant
an open rebuff.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CAVALIER</span></h2>

<p>Nothing can be more striking, in common Italian life,
than the contrast between out-doors and in-doors. Without,
all is fragrant and radiant; within, mouldy, dark, and
damp. Except in the well-kept palaces of the great, houses
in Italy are more like dens than habitations, and a sight of
them is a sufficient reason to the mind of any inquirer,
why their vivacious and handsome inhabitants spend their
life principally in the open air. Nothing could be more
perfectly paradisiacal than this evening at Sorrento. The
sun had sunk, but left the air full of diffused radiance,
which trembled and vibrated over the thousand many-colored
waves of the sea. The moon was riding in a broad
zone of purple, low in the horizon, her silver forehead
somewhat flushed in the general rosiness that seemed
to penetrate and suffuse every object. The fishermen,
who were drawing in their nets, gayly singing, seemed
to be floating on a violet-and-gold-colored flooring that
broke into a thousand gems at every dash of the oar or motion
of the boat. The old stone statue of Saint Antonio
looked down in the rosy air, itself tinged and brightened
by the magical colors which floated round it. And the
girls and men of Sorrento gathered in gossiping knots
on the old Roman bridge that spanned the gorge, looked
idly down into its dusky shadows, talking the while, and
playing the time-honored game of flirtation which has
gone on in all climes and languages since man and woman
began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Conspicuous among them all was Giulietta, her blue-black
hair recently braided and polished to a glossy radiance,
and all her costume arranged to show her comely
proportions to the best advantage,&mdash;her great pearl ear-rings
shaking as she tossed her head, and showing the flash
of the emerald in the middle of them. An Italian peasant-woman
may trust Providence for her gown, but ear-rings
she attends to herself,&mdash;for what is life without them?
The great pearl ear-rings of the Sorrento women are accumulated,
pearl by pearl, as the price of years of labor.
Giulietta, however, had come into the world, so to speak,
with a gold spoon in her mouth,&mdash;since her grandmother,
a thriving, stirring, energetic body, had got together a pair
of ear-rings of unmatched size, which had descended as
heirlooms to her, leaving her nothing to do but display
them, which she did with the freest good-will. At present
she was busily occupied in coquetting with a tall and jauntily-dressed
fellow, wearing a plumed hat and a red sash,
who seemed to be mesmerized by the power of her charms,
his large dark eyes following every movement, as she now
talked with him gayly and freely, and now pretended errands
to this and that and the other person on the bridge,
stationing herself here and there, that she might have the
pleasure of seeing herself followed.</p>

<p>"Giulietta," at last said the young man, earnestly, when
he found her accidentally standing alone by the parapet,
"I must be going to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Well, what is that to me?" said Giulietta, looking
wickedly from under her eyelashes.</p>

<p>"Cruel girl! you <span class="locked">know"&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Nonsense, Pietro! I don't know anything about
you;" but as Giulietta said this, her great, soft, dark eyes
looked out furtively, and said just the contrary.</p>

<p>"You will go with me?"</p>

<p>"Did I ever hear anything like it? One can't be civil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
to a fellow but he asks her to go to the world's end.
Pray, how far is it to your dreadful old den?"</p>

<p>"Only two days' journey, Giulietta."</p>

<p>"Two days!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my life; and you shall ride."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir,&mdash;I wasn't thinking of walking. But
seriously, Pietro, I am afraid it's no place for an honest
girl to be in."</p>

<p>"There are lots of honest women there,&mdash;all our men
have wives; and our captain has put his eye on one, too,
or I'm mistaken."</p>

<p>"What! little Agnes?" said Giulietta. "He will be
bright that gets her. That old dragon of a grandmother is
as tight to her as her skin."</p>

<p>"Our captain is used to helping himself," said Pietro.
"We might carry them both off some night, and no one the
wiser; but he seems to want to win the girl to come to
him of her own accord. At any rate, we are to be sent
back to the mountains while he lingers a day or two more
round here."</p>

<p>"I declare, Pietro, I think you all little better than
Turks or heathens, to talk in that way about carrying off
women; and what if one should be sick and die among
you? What is to become of one's soul, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Pshaw! don't we have priests? Why, Giulietta, we
are all very pious, and never think of going out without
saying our prayers. The Madonna is a kind Mother, and
will wink very hard on the sins of such good sons as we
are. There isn't a place in all Italy where she is kept
better in candles, and in rings and bracelets, and everything
a woman could want. We never come home without
bringing her something; and then we have lots left to
dress all our women like princesses; and they have nothing
to do from morning till night but play the lady. Come
now?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
At the moment this conversation was going on in the
balmy, seductive evening air at the bridge, another was
transpiring in the Albergo della Torre, one of those dark,
musty dens of which we have been speaking. In a damp,
dirty chamber, whose brick floor seemed to have been unsuspicious
of even the existence of brooms for centuries,
was sitting the cavalier whom we have so often named in
connection with Agnes. His easy, high-bred air, his
graceful, flexible form and handsome face formed a singular
contrast to the dark and mouldy apartment, at whose single
unglazed window he was sitting. The sight of this splendid
man gave an impression of strangeness, in the general
bareness, much as if some marvelous jewel had been unaccountably
found lying on that dusty brick floor.</p>

<p>He sat deep in thought, with his elbow resting on a
rickety table, his large, piercing dark eyes seeming intently
to study the pavement.</p>

<p>The door opened, and a gray-headed old man entered,
who approached him respectfully.</p>

<p>"Well, Paolo?" said the cavalier, suddenly starting.</p>

<p>"My Lord, the men are all going back to-night."</p>

<p>"Let them go, then," said the cavalier, with an impatient
movement. "I can follow in a day or two."</p>

<p>"Ah, my Lord, if I might make so bold, why should
you expose your person by staying longer? You may be
recognized <span class="locked">and"&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"No danger," said the other, hastily.</p>

<p>"My Lord, you must forgive me, but I promised my
dear lady, your mother, on her death-<span class="locked">bed"&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"To be a constant plague to me," said the cavalier, with
a vexed smile and an impatient movement; "but speak on,
Paolo,&mdash;for when you once get anything on your mind,
one may as well hear it first as last."</p>

<p>"Well, then, my Lord, this girl,&mdash;I have made inquiries,
and every one reports her most modest and pious,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>the
only grandchild of a poor old woman. Is it worthy
of a great lord of an ancient house to bring her to
shame?"</p>

<p>"Who thinks of bringing her to shame? 'Lord of an
ancient house!'" added the cavalier, laughing bitterly,&mdash;"a
landless beggar, cast out of everything,&mdash;titles, estates,
all! Am I, then, fallen so low that my wooing would disgrace
a peasant-girl?"</p>

<p>"My Lord, you cannot mean to woo a peasant-girl in
any other way than one that would disgrace her,&mdash;one of
the House of Sarelli, that goes back to the days of the old
Roman Empire!"</p>

<p>"And what of the 'House of Sarelli that goes back to
the days of the old Roman Empire'? It is lying like
weeds' roots uppermost in the burning sun. What is left
to me but the mountains and my sword? No, I tell you,
Paolo, Agostino Sarelli, cavalier of fortune, is not thinking
of bringing disgrace on a pious and modest maiden,
unless it would disgrace her to be his wife."</p>

<p>"Now may the saints above help us! Why, my Lord,
our house in days past has been allied to royal blood. I
could tell you how Joachim <span class="locked">VI."&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Come, come, my good Paolo, spare me one of your
chapters of genealogy. The fact is, my old boy, the world
is all topsy-turvy, and the bottom is the top, and it isn't
much matter what comes next. Here are shoals of noble
families uprooted and lying round like those aloes that the
gardener used to throw over the wall in springtime; and
there is that great boar of a Cæsar Borgia turned in to batten
and riot over our pleasant places."</p>

<p>"Oh, my Lord," said the old serving-man, with a distressful
movement, "we have fallen on evil times, to be
sure, and they say his Holiness has excommunicated us.
Anselmo heard that in Naples yesterday."</p>

<p>"Excommunicated!" said the young man,&mdash;every feature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
of his fine face, and every nerve of his graceful form
seeming to quiver with the effort to express supreme contempt.
"Excommunicated! I should hope so! One
would hope through Our Lady's grace to act so that Alexander,
and his adulterous, incestuous, filthy, false-swearing,
perjured, murderous crew, would excommunicate us! In
these times, one's only hope of paradise lies in being excommunicated."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear master," said the old man, falling on his
knees, "what is to become of us? That I should live to
hear you talk like an infidel and unbeliever!"</p>

<p>"Why, hear you, poor old fool! Did you never hear in
Dante of the Popes that are burning in hell? Wasn't
Dante a Christian, I beg to know?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my Lord, my Lord! a religion got out of poetry,
books, and romances won't do to die by. We have no
business with the affairs of the Head of the Church,&mdash;it's
the Lord's appointment. We have only to shut our eyes
and obey. It may all do well enough to talk so when you
are young and fresh; but when sickness and death come,
then we <i>must</i> have religion,&mdash;and if we have gone out of
the only true Roman Catholic Apostolic Church, what becomes
of our souls? Ah, I misdoubted about your taking
so much to poetry, though my poor mistress was so proud
of it; but these poets are all heretics, my Lord,&mdash;that's
my firm belief. But, my Lord, if you do go to hell, I'm
going there with you; I'm sure I never could show my
face among the saints, and you not there."</p>

<p>"Well, come, then, my poor Paolo," said the cavalier,
stretching out his hand to his serving-man, "don't take it
to heart so. Many a better man than I has been excommunicated
and cursed from toe to crown, and been never
a whit the worse for it. There's Jerome Savonarola there
in Florence&mdash;a most holy man, they say, who has had
revelations straight from heaven&mdash;has been excommunicated;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
but he preaches and gives the sacraments all the
same, and nobody minds it."</p>

<p>"Well, it's all a maze to me," said the old serving-man,
shaking his white head. "I can't see into it. I don't
dare to open my eyes for fear I should get to be a heretic;
it seems to me that everything is getting mixed up together.
But one must hold on to one's religion; because,
after we have lost everything in this world, it would be
too bad to burn in hell forever at the end of that."</p>

<p>"Why, Paolo, I am a good Christian. I believe, with
all my heart, in the Christian religion, like the fellow in
Boccaccio,&mdash;because I think it must be from God, or else
the Popes and Cardinals would have had it out of the
world long ago. Nothing but the Lord Himself could have
kept it against them."</p>

<p>"There you are, my dear master, with your romances.
Well, well, well! I don't know how it'll end. I say my
prayers, and try not to inquire into what's too high for
me. But now, dear master, will you stay lingering after
this girl till some of our enemies hear where you are and
pounce down upon us? Besides, the troop are never so
well affected when you are away; there are quarrels and
divisions."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the cavalier, with an impatient movement,&mdash;"one
day longer. I must get a chance to speak
with her once more. I must see her."</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ARTIST MONK</span></h2>

<p>On the evening when Agnes and her grandmother returned
from the Convent, as they were standing after supper
looking over the garden parapet into the gorge, their
attention was caught by a man in an ecclesiastical habit,
slowly climbing the rocky pathway towards them.</p>

<p>"Isn't that Brother Antonio?" said Dame Elsie, leaning
forward to observe more narrowly. "Yes, to be sure
it is!"</p>

<p>"Oh, how glad I am!" exclaimed Agnes, springing up
with vivacity, and looking eagerly down the path by which
the stranger was approaching.</p>

<p>A few moments more of clambering, and the stranger met
the two women at the gate with a gesture of benediction.</p>

<p>He was apparently a little past the middle point of life,
and entering on its shady afternoon. He was tall and well
proportioned, and his features had the spare delicacy of the
Italian outline. The round brow, fully developed in all
the perceptive and æsthetic regions,&mdash;the keen eye, shadowed
by long, dark lashes,&mdash;the thin, flexible lips,&mdash;the
sunken cheek, where, on the slightest emotion, there fluttered
a brilliant flush of color,&mdash;all were signs telling of
the enthusiast in whom the nervous and spiritual predominated
over the animal.</p>

<p>At times, his eye had a dilating brightness, as if from
the flickering of some inward fire which was slowly consuming
the mortal part, and its expression was brilliant
even to the verge of insanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
His dress was the simple, coarse, white stuff-gown of
the Dominican friars, over which he wore a darker traveling-garment
of coarse cloth, with a hood, from whose deep
shadows his bright mysterious eyes looked like jewels from
a cavern. At his side dangled a great rosary and cross
of black wood, and under his arm he carried a portfolio
secured with a leathern strap, which seemed stuffed to
bursting with papers.</p>

<p>Father Antonio, whom we have thus introduced to the
reader, was an itinerant preaching monk from the Convent
of San Marco in Florence, on a pastoral and artistic tour
through Italy.</p>

<p>Convents in the Middle Ages were the retreats of multitudes
of natures who did not wish to live in a state of
perpetual warfare and offense, and all the elegant arts flourished
under their protecting shadows. Ornamental gardening,
pharmacy, drawing, painting, carving in wood, illumination,
and calligraphy were not unfrequent occupations
of the holy fathers, and the convent has given to the
illustrious roll of Italian Art some of its most brilliant
names. No institution in modern Europe had a more established
reputation in all these respects than the Convent
of San Marco in Florence. In its best days, it was as near
an approach to an ideal community, associated to unite
religion, beauty, and utility, as ever has existed on earth.
It was a retreat from the commonplace prose of life into an
atmosphere at once devotional and poetic; and prayers and
sacred hymns consecrated the elegant labors of the chisel
and the pencil, no less than the more homely ones of the
still and the crucible. San Marco, far from being that
kind of sluggish lagoon often imagined in conventual life,
was rather a sheltered hotbed of ideas, fervid with intellectual
and moral energy, and before the age in every
radical movement. At this period, Savonarola, the poet
and prophet of the Italian religious world of his day, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
superior of this convent, pouring through all the members
of the order the fire of his own impassioned nature, and
seeking to lead them back to the fervors of more primitive
and evangelical ages, and in the reaction of a worldly and
corrupt Church was beginning to feel the power of that
current which at last drowned his eloquent voice in the
cold waters of martyrdom. Savonarola was an Italian
Luther,&mdash;differing from the great Northern Reformer as
the more ethereally strung and nervous Italian differs from
the bluff and burly German; and like Luther, he became
in his time the centre of every living thing in society about
him. He inspired the pencils of artists, guided the counsels
of statesmen, and, a poet himself, was an inspiration
to poets. Everywhere in Italy the monks of his order
were traveling, restoring the shrines, preaching against the
voluptuous and unworthy pictures with which sensual artists
had desecrated the churches, and calling the people
back by their exhortations to the purity of primitive Christianity.</p>

<p>Father Antonio was a younger brother of Elsie, and had
early become a member of the San Marco, enthusiastic not
less in religion than in Art. His intercourse with his sister
had few points of sympathy, Elsie being as decided a
utilitarian as any old Yankee female born in the granite
hills of New Hampshire, and pursuing with a hard and
sharp energy her narrow plan of life for Agnes. She
regarded her brother as a very properly religious person,
considering his calling, but was a little bored with his exuberant
devotion, and absolutely indifferent to his artistic
enthusiasm. Agnes, on the contrary, had from a child
attached herself to her uncle with all the energy of a sympathetic
nature, and his yearly visits had been looked forward
to on her part with intense expectation. To him
she could say a thousand things which she instinctively concealed
from her grandmother; and Elsie was well pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
with the confidence, because it relieved her a little from
the vigilant guardianship that she otherwise held over the
girl. When Father Antonio was near, she had leisure now
and then for a little private gossip of her own, without the
constant care of supervising Agnes.</p>

<p>"Dear uncle, how glad I am to see you once more!"
was the eager salutation with which the young girl received
the monk, as he gained the little garden. "And you have
brought your pictures; oh, I know you have so many
pretty things to show me!"</p>

<p>"Well, well, child," said Elsie, "don't begin upon that
now. A little talk of bread and cheese will be more in
point. Come in, brother, and wash your feet, and let me
beat the dust out of your cloak, and give you something to
stay Nature; for you must be fasting."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sister," said the monk; "and as for you,
pretty one, never mind what she says. Uncle Antonio
will show his little Agnes everything by-and-by. A good
little thing it is, sister."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes,&mdash;good enough,&mdash;and too good," said Elsie,
bustling about; "roses can't help having thorns, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Only our ever-blessed Rose of Sharon, the dear mystical
Rose of Paradise, can boast of having no thorns," said
the monk, bowing and crossing himself devoutly.</p>

<p>Agnes clasped her hands on her bosom and bowed also,
while Elsie stopped with her knife in the middle of a loaf
of black bread, and crossed herself with somewhat of impatience,&mdash;like
a worldly-minded person of our day, who
is interrupted in the midst of an observation by a grace.</p>

<p>After the rites of hospitality had been duly observed, the
old dame seated herself contentedly in her door with her
distaff, resigned Agnes to the safe guardianship of her
uncle, and had a feeling of security in seeing them sitting
together on the parapet of the garden, with the portfolio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
spread out between them,&mdash;the warm twilight glow of the
evening sky lighting up their figures as they bent in ardent
interest over its contents. The portfolio showed a fluttering
collection of sketches,&mdash;fruits, flowers, animals, insects,
faces, figures, shrines, buildings, trees,&mdash;all, in short, that
might strike the mind of a man to whose eye nothing on
the face of the earth is without beauty and significance.</p>

<p>"Oh, how beautiful!" said the girl, taking up one
sketch, in which a bunch of rosy cyclamen was painted
rising out of a bed of moss.</p>

<p>"Ah, that indeed, my dear!" said the artist. "Would
you had seen the place where I painted it! I stopped
there to recite my prayers one morning; 'twas by the side
of a beautiful cascade, and all the ground was covered with
these lovely cyclamens, and the air was musky with their
fragrance. Ah, the bright rose-colored leaves! I can get
no color like them, unless some angel would bring me some
from those sunset clouds yonder."</p>

<p>"And oh, dear uncle, what lovely primroses!" pursued
Agnes, taking up another paper.</p>

<p>"Yes, child; but you should have seen them when I
was coming down the south side of the Apennines; these
were everywhere so pale and sweet, they seemed like the
humility of our Most Blessed Mother in her lowly mortal
state. I am minded to make a border of primroses to the
leaf in the Breviary where is the 'Hail, Mary!'&mdash;for it
seems as if that flower doth ever say, 'Behold the handmaid
of the Lord!'"</p>

<p>"And what will you do with the cyclamen, uncle? does
not that mean something?"</p>

<p>"Yes, daughter," replied the monk, readily entering into
that symbolical strain which permeated all the heart and
mind of the religious of his day, "I can see a meaning in
it. For you see that the cyclamen puts forth its leaves
in early spring deeply engraven with mystical characters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
and loves cool shadows, and moist, dark places, but comes
at length to wear a royal crown of crimson; and it seems
to me like the saints who dwell in convents and other
prayerful places, and have the word of God graven in their
hearts in youth, till these blossom into fervent love, and
they are crowned with royal graces."</p>

<p>"Ah!" sighed Agnes, "how beautiful and how blessed
to be among such!"</p>

<p>"Thou sayest well, dear child. Blessed are the flowers
of God that grow in cool solitudes, and have never been
profaned by the hot sun and dust of this world!"</p>

<p>"I should like to be such a one," said Agnes. "I often
think, when I visit the sisters at the Convent, that I long
to be one of them."</p>

<p>"A pretty story!" said Dame Elsie, who had heard
the last words, "go into a convent and leave your poor
grandmother all alone, when she has toiled night and day
for so many years to get a dowry for you and find you a
worthy husband!"</p>

<p>"I don't want any husband in this world, grandmamma,"
said Agnes.</p>

<p>"What talk is this? Not want a good husband to take
care of you when your poor old grandmother is gone? Who
will provide for you?"</p>

<p>"He who took care of the blessed Saint Agnes, grandmamma."</p>

<p>"Saint Agnes, to be sure! That was a great many years
ago, and times have altered since then; in these days girls
must have husbands. Isn't it so, Brother Antonio?"</p>

<p>"But if the darling hath a vocation?" said the artist,
mildly.</p>

<p>"Vocation! I'll see to that! She sha'n't have a vocation!
Suppose I'm going to delve, and toil, and spin,
and wear myself to the bone, and have her slip through
my fingers at last with a vocation? No, indeed!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
"Indeed, dear grandmother, don't be angry!" said
Agnes. "I will do just as you say,&mdash;only I don't want
a husband."</p>

<p>"Well, well, my little heart,&mdash;one thing at a time;
you shan't have him till you say yes willingly," said
Elsie, in a mollified tone.</p>

<p>Agnes turned again to the portfolio and busied herself
with it, her eyes dilating as she ran over the sketches.</p>

<p>"Ah! what pretty, pretty bird is this?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Knowest thou not that bird, with his little red beak?"
said the artist. "When our dear Lord hung bleeding, and
no man pitied him, this bird, filled with tender love, tried
to draw out the nails with his poor little beak,&mdash;so much
better were the birds than we hard-hearted sinners!&mdash;hence
he hath honor in many pictures. See here,&mdash;I
shall put him into the office of the Sacred Heart, in a little
nest curiously built in a running vine of passion-flower.
See here, daughter,&mdash;I have a great commission to execute
a Breviary for our house, and our holy Father was
pleased to say that the spirit of the blessed Angelico had
in some little humble measure descended on me, and now
I am busy day and night; for not a twig rustles, not a
bird flies, nor a flower blossoms, but I begin to see therein
some hint of holy adornment to my blessed work."</p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle Antonio, how happy you must be!" said
Agnes, her large eyes filling with tears.</p>

<p>"Happy!&mdash;child, am I not?" said the monk, looking
up and crossing himself. "Holy Mother, am I not? Do
I not walk the earth in a dream of bliss, and see the footsteps
of my Most Blessed Lord and his dear Mother on
every rock and hill? I see the flowers rise up in clouds
to adore them. What am I, unworthy sinner, that such
grace is granted me? Often I fall on my face before the
humblest flower where my dear Lord hath written his
name, and confess I am unworthy the honor of copying his
sweet handiwork."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
The artist spoke these words with his hands clasped and
his fervid eyes upraised, like a man in an ecstasy; nor can
our more prosaic English give an idea of the fluent naturalness
and grace with which such images melt into that lovely
tongue which seems made to be the natural language of
poetry and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Agnes looked up to him with humble awe, as to some
celestial being; but there was a sympathetic glow in her
face, and she put her hands on her bosom, as her manner
often was when much moved, and, drawing a deep sigh,
<span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Would that such gifts were mine!"</p>

<p>"They are thine, sweet one," said the monk. "In
Christ's dear kingdom is no mine or thine, but all that
each hath is the property of others. I never rejoice so
much in my art as when I think of the communion of
saints, and that all that our Blessed Lord will work
through me is the property of the humblest soul in his
kingdom. When I see one flower rarer than another, or
a bird singing on a twig, I take note of the same, and say,
'This lovely work of God shall be for some shrine, or the
border of a missal, or the foreground of an altar-piece, and
thus shall his saints be comforted.'"</p>

<p>"But," said Agnes, fervently, "how little can a poor
young maiden do! Ah, I do so long to offer myself up in
some way to the dear Lord, who gave himself for us, and
for his Most Blessed Church!"</p>

<p>As Agnes spoke these words, her cheek, usually so clear
and pale, became suffused with a tremulous color, and her
dark eyes had a deep, divine expression; a moment after,
the color slowly faded, her head drooped, and her long,
dark lashes fell on her cheek, while her hands were folded
on her bosom. The eye of the monk was watching her
with an enkindled glance.</p>

<p>"Is she not the very presentment of our Blessed Lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
in the Annunciation?" said he to himself. "Surely, this
grace is upon her for this special purpose. My prayers are
answered."</p>

<p>"Daughter," he began, in a gentle tone, "a glorious work
has been done of late in Florence under the preaching of
our blessed Superior. Could you believe it, daughter, in
these times of backsliding and rebuke there have been
found painters base enough to paint the pictures of vile,
abandoned women in the character of our Blessed Lady;
yea, and princes have been found wicked enough to buy
them and put them up in churches, so that the people have
had the Mother of all Purity presented to them in the
guise of a vile harlot. Is it not dreadful?"</p>

<p>"How horrible!" said Agnes.</p>

<p>"Ah, but you should have seen the great procession
through Florence, when all the little children were inspired
by the heavenly preaching of our dear Master. These dear
little ones, carrying the blessed cross and singing the hymns
our Master had written for them, went from house to
house and church to church, demanding that everything
that was vile and base should be delivered up to the flames,&mdash;and
the people, beholding, thought that the angels had
indeed come down, and brought forth all their loose pictures
and vile books, such as Boccaccio's romances and
other defilements, and the children made a splendid bonfire
of them in the Grand Piazza, and so thousands of vile
things were consumed and scattered. And then our blessed
Master exhorted the artists to give their pencils to Christ
and his Mother, and to seek for her image among pious
and holy women living a veiled and secluded life, like that
our Lady lived before the blessed Annunciation. 'Think
you,' he said, 'that the blessed Angelico obtained the grace
to set forth our Lady in such heavenly wise by gazing
about the streets on mincing women tricked out in all the
world's bravery?&mdash;or did he not find her image in holy
solitudes, among modest and prayerful saints?'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
"Ah," said Agnes, drawing in her breath with an expression
of awe, "what mortal would dare to sit for the image
of our Lady!"</p>

<p>"Dear child, there be women whom the Lord crowns
with beauty when they know it not, and our dear Mother
sheds so much of her spirit into their hearts that it shines
out in their faces; and among such must the painter look.
Dear little child, be not ignorant that our Lord hath shed
this great grace on thee. I have received a light that thou
art to be the model for the 'Hail Mary!' in my Breviary."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no! it cannot be!" said Agnes, covering
her face with her hands.</p>

<p>"My daughter, thou art very beautiful, and this beauty
was given thee not for thyself, but to be laid like a sweet
flower on the altar of thy Lord. Think how blessed, if,
through thee, the faithful be reminded of the modesty and
humility of Mary, so that their prayers become more fervent,&mdash;would
it not be a great grace?"</p>

<p>"Dear uncle," said Agnes, "I am Christ's child. If it
be as you say,&mdash;which I did not know,&mdash;give me some
days to pray and prepare my soul, that I may offer myself
in all humility."</p>

<p>During this conversation Elsie had left the garden and
gone a little way down the gorge, to have a few moments
of gossip with an old crony. The light of the evening sky
had gradually faded away, and the full moon was pouring
a shower of silver upon the orange-trees. As Agnes sat
on the parapet, with the moonlight streaming down on her
young, spiritual face, now tremulous with deep suppressed
emotion, the painter thought he had never seen any human
creature that looked nearer to his conception of a celestial
being.</p>

<p>They both sat awhile in that kind of quietude which
often falls between two who have stirred some deep fountain
of emotion. All was so still around them, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
drip and trickle of the little stream which fell from the
garden wall into the dark abyss of the gorge could well be
heard as it pattered from one rocky point to another, with
a slender, lulling sound.</p>

<p>Suddenly the reveries of the two were disturbed by the
shadow of a figure which passed into the moonlight and
seemed to rise from the side of the gorge. A man enveloped
in a dark cloak with a peaked hood stepped across
the moss-grown garden parapet, stood a moment irresolute,
then the cloak dropped suddenly from him, and the cavalier
stood in the moonlight before Agnes. He bore in his
hand a tall stalk of white lily, with open blossoms and
buds and tender fluted green leaves, such as one sees in a
thousand pictures of the Annunciation. The moonlight
fell full upon his face, revealing his haughty yet beautiful
features, agitated by some profound emotion. The monk
and the girl were both too much surprised for a moment to
utter a sound; and when, after an instant, the monk made
a half-movement as if to address him, the cavalier raised
his right hand with a sudden authoritative gesture which
silenced him. Then turning toward Agnes, he kneeled,
and kissing the hem of her robe, and laying the lily in her
lap, "Holiest and dearest," he said, "oh, forget not to pray
for me!" He rose again in a moment, and, throwing his
cloak around him, sprang over the garden wall, and was
heard rapidly descending into the shadows of the gorge.</p>

<p>All this passed so quickly that it seemed to both the
spectators like a dream. The splendid man, with his jeweled
weapons, his haughty bearing, and air of easy command,
bowing with such solemn humility before the peasant-girl,
reminded the monk of the barbaric princes in the
wonderful legends he had read, who had been drawn by
some heavenly inspiration to come and render themselves
up to the teachings of holy virgins, chosen of the Lord, in
divine solitudes. In the poetical world in which he lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
all such marvels were possible. There were a thousand
precedents for them in that devout dreamland, "The Lives
of the Saints."</p>

<p>"My daughter," he said, after looking vainly down the
dark shadows upon the path of the stranger, "have you
ever seen this man before?"</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle; yesterday evening I saw him for the first
time, when sitting at my stand at the gate of the city. It
was at the Ave Maria; he came up there and asked my
prayers, and gave me a diamond ring for the shrine of
Saint Agnes, which I carried to the convent to-day."</p>

<p>"Behold, my dear daughter, the confirmation of what
I have just said to thee! It is evident that our Lady
hath endowed thee with the great grace of a beauty which
draws the soul upward towards the angels, instead of downward
to sensual things, like the beauty of worldly women.
What saith the blessed poet Dante of the beauty of the
holy Beatrice?&mdash;that it said to every man who looked on
her, '<i>Aspire!</i>'<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Great is the grace, and thou must give
special praise therefor."</p>

<p>"I would," said Agnes, thoughtfully, "that I knew who
this stranger is, and what is his great trouble and need,&mdash;his
eyes are so full of sorrow. Giulietta said he was the
King's brother, and was called the Lord Adrian. What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
sorrow can he have, or what need for the prayers of a poor
maid like me?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps the Lord hath pierced him with a longing
after the celestial beauty and heavenly purity of paradise,
and wounded him with a divine sorrow, as happened to
Saint Francis and to the blessed Saint Dominic," said the
monk. "Beauty is the Lord's arrow, wherewith he pierceth
to the inmost soul, with a divine longing and languishment
which find rest only in him. Hence thou seest the wounds
of love in saints are always painted by us with holy flames
ascending from them. Have good courage, sweet child,
and pray with fervor for this youth; for there be no prayers
sweeter before the throne of God than those of spotless
maidens. The Scripture saith, 'My beloved feedeth among
the lilies.'"</p>

<p>At this moment the sharp, decided tramp of Elsie was
heard reëntering the garden.</p>

<p>"Come, Agnes," she said, "it is time for you to begin
your prayers, or, the saints know, I shall not get you to
bed till midnight. I suppose prayers are a good thing,"
she added, seating herself wearily; "but if one must have
so many of them, one must get about them early. There's
reason in all things."</p>

<p>Agnes, who had been sitting abstractedly on the parapet,
with her head drooped over the lily-spray, now seemed to
collect herself. She rose up in a grave and thoughtful
manner, and, going forward to the shrine of the Madonna,
removed the flowers of the morning, and holding the vase
under the spout of the fountain, all feathered with waving
maiden-hair, filled it with fresh water, the drops falling
from it in a thousand little silver rings in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"I have a thought," said the monk to himself, drawing
from his girdle a pencil and hastily sketching by the moonlight.
What he drew was a fragile maiden form, sitting
with clasped hands on a mossy ruin, gazing on a spray of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
white lilies which lay before her. He called it, The
Blessed Virgin pondering the Lily of the Annunciation.</p>

<p>"Hast thou ever reflected," he said to Agnes, "what
that lily might be like which the angel Gabriel brought to
our Lady?&mdash;for, trust me, it was no mortal flower, but
grew by the river of life. I have often meditated thereon,
that it was like unto living silver with a light in itself, like
the moon,&mdash;even as our Lord's garments in the Transfiguration,
which glistened like the snow. I have cast about
in myself by what device a painter might represent so marvelous
a flower."</p>

<p>"Now, brother Antonio," said Elsie, "if you begin to
talk to the child about such matters, our Lady alone knows
when we shall get to bed. I am sure I'm as good a Christian
as anybody; but, as I said, there's reason in all
things, and one cannot always be wondering and inquiring
into heavenly matters,&mdash;as to every feather in Saint Michael's
wings, and as to our Lady's girdle and shoestrings
and thimble and work-basket; and when one gets through
with our Lady, then one has it all to go over about her
mother, the blessed Saint Anne (may her name be ever
praised!). I mean no disrespect, but I am certain the
saints are reasonable folk and must see that poor folk must
live, and, in order to live, must think of something else
now and then besides <i>them</i>. That's my mind, brother."</p>

<p>"Well, well, sister," said the monk, placidly, "no doubt
you are right. There shall be no quarreling in the Lord's
vineyard; every one hath his manner and place, and you
follow the lead of the blessed Saint Martha, which is holy
and honorable."</p>

<p>"Honorable! I should think it might be!" said Elsie.
"I warrant me, if everything had been left to Saint Mary's
doings, our Blessed Lord and the Twelve Apostles might
have gone supperless. But it's Martha gets all the work,
and Mary all the praise."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
"Quite right, quite right," said the monk, abstractedly,
while he stood out in the moonlight busily sketching the
fountain. By just such a fountain, he thought, our Lady
might have washed the clothes of the Blessed Babe. Doubtless
there was some such in the court of her dwelling, all
mossy, and with sweet waters forever singing a song of
praise therein.</p>

<p>Elsie was heard within the house meanwhile making
energetic commotion, rattling pots and pans, and producing
decided movements among the simple furniture of the
dwelling, probably with a view to preparing for the night's
repose of the guest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Agnes, kneeling before the shrine, was going
through with great feeling and tenderness the various manuals
and movements of nightly devotion which her own
religious fervor and the zeal of her spiritual advisers had
enjoined upon her. Christianity, when it entered Italy,
came among a people every act of whose life was colored
and consecrated by symbolic and ritual acts of heathenism.
The only possible way to uproot this was in supplanting it
by Christian ritual and symbolism equally minute and pervading.
Besides, in those ages when the Christian preacher
was utterly destitute of all the help which the press now
gives in keeping under the eye of converts the great inspiring
truths of religion, it was one of the first offices of every
saint whose preaching stirred the heart of the people, to
devise symbolic forms, signs, and observances, by which
the mobile and fluid heart of the multitude might crystalize
into habits of devout remembrance. The rosary, the
crucifix, the shrine, the banner, the procession, were catechisms
and tracts invented for those who could not read,
wherein the substance of pages was condensed and gave
itself to the eye and the touch. Let us not, from the
height of our day, with the better appliances which a universal
press gives us, sneer at the homely rounds of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
ladder by which the first multitudes of the Lord's followers
climbed heavenward.</p>

<p>If there seemed somewhat mechanical in the number of
times which Agnes repeated the "Hail, Mary!"&mdash;in the
prescribed number of times she rose or bowed or crossed
herself or laid her forehead in low humility on the flags of
the pavement, it was redeemed by the earnest fervor which
inspired each action. However foreign to the habits of a
Northern mind or education such a mode of prayer may be,
these forms to her were all helpful and significant, her soul
was borne by them Godward,&mdash;and often, as she prayed,
it seemed to her that she could feel the dissolving of all
earthly things, and the pressing nearer and nearer of the
great cloud of witnesses who ever surround the humblest
member of Christ's mystical body.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweet loving hearts around her beat,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sweet helping hands are stirred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And palpitates the veil between<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Certain English writers, looking entirely from a worldly
and philosophical standpoint, are utterly at a loss to account
for the power which certain Italian women of obscure birth
came to exercise in the councils of nations merely by the
force of a mystical piety; but the Northern mind of Europe
is entirely unfitted to read and appreciate the psychological
religious phenomena of Southern races. The temperament
which in our modern days has been called the mediïstic,
and which with us is only exceptional, is more or less a
race-peculiarity of Southern climates, and gives that objectiveness
to the conception of spiritual things from which
grew up a whole ritual and a whole world of religious Art.
The Southern saints and religious artists were seers,&mdash;men
and women of that peculiar fineness and delicacy of
temperament which made them especially apt to receive
and project outward the truths of the spiritual life; they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
were in that state of "divine madness" which is favorable
to the most intense conception of the poet and artist, and
something of this influence descended through all the channels
of the people.</p>

<p>When Agnes rose from prayer, she had a serene, exalted
expression, like one who walks with some unseen excellence
and meditates on some untold joy. As she was crossing
the court to come towards her uncle, her eye was attracted
by the sparkle of something on the ground, and, stooping,
she picked up a heart-shaped locket, curiously made of a
large amethyst, and fastened with a golden arrow. As she
pressed upon this, the locket opened and disclosed to her
view a folded paper. Her mood at this moment was so
calm and elevated that she received the incident with no
start or shiver of the nerves. To her it seemed a providential
token, which would probably bring to her some
further knowledge of this mysterious being who had been
so especially confided to her intercessions.</p>

<p>Agnes had learned of the Superior of the Convent the
art of reading writing, which would never have been the
birthright of the peasant-girl in her times, and the moon
had that dazzling clearness which revealed every letter.
She stood by the parapet, one hand lying in the white
blossoming alyssum which filled its marble crevices, while
she read and seriously pondered the contents of the paper.</p>

There might have been times in Agnes's life when the
reception of this note would have astonished and perplexed
her; but the whole strain of thought and conversation this
evening had been in exalted and poetical regions, and the
soft stillness of the hour, the wonderful calmness and clearness
of the moonlight, all seemed in unison with the strange
incident that had occurred, and with the still stranger tenor
of the paper. The soft melancholy, half-religious tone of
it was in accordance with the whole undercurrent of her
life, and prevented that start of alarm which any homage
of a more worldly form might have excited. It is not to
be wondered at, therefore, that she read it many times with
pauses and intervals of deep thought, and then with a
movement of natural and girlish curiosity examined the rich
jewel which had enclosed it. At last, seeming to collect
her thoughts, she folded the paper and replaced it in its
sparkling casket, and, unlocking the door of the shrine,
laid the gem with its enclosure beneath the lily-spray, as
another offering to the Madonna. "Dear Mother," she
said, "if indeed it be so, may he rise from loving me to
loving thee and thy dear Son, who is Lord of all! Amen!"
Thus praying, she locked the door and turned thoughtfully
to her repose, leaving the monk pacing up and down in the
moonlit garden.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the cavalier was standing on the velvet mossy
bridge which spanned the stream at the bottom of the
gorge, watching the play of moonbeams on layer after layer
of tremulous silver foliage in the clefts of the black, rocky
walls on either side. The moon rode so high in the deep
violet-colored sky, that her beams came down almost vertically,
making green and translucent the leaves through
which they passed, and throwing strongly marked shadows
here and there on the flower-embroidered moss of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
bridge. There was that solemn, plaintive stillness in the
air which makes the least sound&mdash;the hum of an insect's
wing, the cracking of a twig, the patter of falling water&mdash;so
distinct and impressive.</p>

<p>It needs not to be explained how the cavalier, following
the steps of Agnes and her grandmother at a distance, had
threaded the path by which they ascended to their little
sheltered nook,&mdash;how he had lingered within hearing of
Agnes's voice, and, moving among the surrounding rocks
and trees, and drawing nearer and nearer as evening shadows
drew on, had listened to the conversation, hoping that
some unexpected chance might gain him a moment's speech
with his enchantress.</p>

<p>The reader will have gathered from the preceding chapter
that the conception which Agnes had formed as to the
real position of her admirer from the reports of Giulietta
was false, and that in reality he was not Lord Adrian, the
brother of the King, but an outcast and landless representative
of one branch of an ancient and noble Roman family,
whose estates had been confiscated and whose relations had
been murdered, to satisfy the boundless rapacity of Cæsar
Borgia, the infamous favorite of the notorious Alexander
VI.</p>

<p>The natural temperament of Agostino Sarelli had been
rather that of the poet and artist than of the warrior. In
the beautiful gardens of his ancestral home it had been his
delight to muse over the pages of Dante; to sing to the
lute, and to write, in the facile flowing rhyme of his native
Italian, the fancies of the dreamland of his youth.</p>

<p>He was the younger brother of the family,&mdash;the favorite
son and companion of his mother, who, being of a tender
and religious nature, had brought him up in habits of
the most implicit reverence and devotion for the institutions
of his fathers.</p>

<p>The storm which swept over his house, and blasted all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
his worldly prospects, blasted, too, and withered all those
religious hopes and beliefs by which alone sensitive and
affectionate natures can be healed of the wounds of adversity
without leaving distortion or scar. For his house had
been overthrown, his elder brother cruelly and treacherously
murdered, himself and his retainers robbed and cast
out, by a man who had the entire sanction and support of
the Head of the Christian Church, the Vicar of Christ on
Earth. So said the current belief of his times,&mdash;the faith
in which his sainted mother died; and the difficulty with
which a man breaks away from such ties is in exact proportion
to the refinement and elevation of his nature.</p>

<p>In the mind of our young nobleman there was a double
current. He was a Roman, and the traditions of his house
went back to the time of Mutius Scævola; and his old
nurse had often told him that grand story of how the
young hero stood with his right hand in the fire rather
than betray his honor. If the legends of Rome's ancient
heroes cause the pulses of colder climes and alien races to
throb with sympathetic heroism, what must their power be
to one who says, "These were my fathers"? Agostino
read Plutarch, and thought, "I, too, am a Roman!" and
then he looked on the power that held sway over the
Tarpeian Rock and the halls of the old "Sanctus Senatus,"
and asked himself, "By what right does it hold these?"
He knew full well that in the popular belief all those
hardy and virtuous old Romans whose deeds of heroism so
transported him were burning in hell for the crime of having
been born before Christ; and he asked himself, as he
looked on the horrible and unnatural luxury and vice which
defiled the Papal chair and ran riot through every ecclesiastical
order, whether such men, without faith, without conscience,
and without even decency, were indeed the only
authorized successors of Christ and his Apostles?</p>

<p>To us, of course, from our modern standpoint, the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
has an easy solution,&mdash;but not so in those days, when
the Christianity of the known world was in the Romish
church, and when the choice seemed to be between that
and infidelity. Not yet had Luther flared aloft the bold,
cheery torch which showed the faithful how to disentangle
Christianity from Ecclesiasticism. Luther in those days
was a star lying low in the gray horizon of a yet unawakened
dawn.</p>

<p>All through Italy at this time there was the restless
throbbing and pulsating, the aimless outreach of the popular
heart, which marks the decline of one cycle of religious
faith and calls for some great awakening and renewal.
Savonarola, the priest and prophet of this dumb desire, was
beginning to heave a great heart of conflict towards that
mighty struggle with the vices and immoralities of his time
in which he was yet to sink a martyr; and even now his
course was beginning to be obstructed by the full energy
of the whole aroused serpent brood which hissed and
knotted in the holy places of Rome.</p>

<p>Here, then, was our Agostino, with a nature intensely
fervent and poetic, every fibre of whose soul and nervous
system had been from childhood skillfully woven and intertwined
with the ritual and faith of his fathers, yearning
towards the grave of his mother, yearning towards the
legends of saints and angels with which she had lulled his
cradle slumbers and sanctified his childhood's pillow, and
yet burning with the indignation of a whole line of old
Roman ancestors against an injustice and oppression wrought
under the full approbation of the head of that religion.
Half his nature was all the while battling the other half.
Would he be Roman, or would he be Christian? All the
Roman in him said "No!" when he thought of submission
to the patent and open injustice and fiendish tyranny
which had disinherited him, slain his kindred, and held
its impure reign by torture and by blood. He looked on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
the splendid snow-crowned mountains whose old silver
senate engirdles Rome with an eternal and silent majesty
of presence, and he thought how often in ancient times
they had been a shelter to free blood that would not endure
oppression; and so gathering to his banner the crushed
and scattered retainers of his father's house, and offering
refuge and protection to multitudes of others whom the
crimes and rapacities of the Borgias had stripped of possessions
and means of support, he fled to a fastness in the
mountains between Rome and Naples, and became an independent
chieftain, living by his sword.</p>

<p>The rapacity, cruelty, and misgovernment of the various
regular authorities of Italy at this time made brigandage a
respectable and honored institution in the eyes of the people,
though it was ostensibly banned both by Pope and
Prince. Besides, in the multitude of contending factions
which were every day wrangling for supremacy, it soon
became apparent, even to the ruling authorities, that a
band of fighting men under a gallant leader, advantageously
posted in the mountains and understanding all their passes,
was a power of no small importance to be employed on one
side or the other; and therefore it happened, that, though
nominally outlawed or excommunicated, they were secretly
protected on both sides, with a view to securing their assistance
in critical turns of affairs.</p>

<p>Among the common people of the towns and villages
their relations were of the most comfortable kind, their
depredations being chiefly confined to the rich and prosperous,
who, as they wrung their wealth out of the people,
were not considered particular objects of compassion when
the same kind of high-handed treatment was extended
toward themselves.</p>

<p>The most spirited and brave of the young peasantry, if
they wished to secure the smiles of the girls of their neighborhood,
and win hearts past redemption, found no surer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
avenue to favor than in joining the brigands. The leaders
of these bands sometimes piqued themselves on elegant
tastes and accomplishments; and one of them is said to
have sent to the poet Tasso, in his misfortunes and exile,
an offer of honorable asylum and protection in his mountain
fortress.</p>

<p>Agostino Sarelli saw himself, in fact, a powerful chief,
and there were times when the splendid scenery of his
mountain fastness, its inspiring air, its wild eagle-like grandeur,
independence, and security, gave him a proud contentment,
and he looked at his sword and loved it as a
bride. But then again there were moods in which he felt
all that yearning and disquiet of soul which the man of
wide and tender moral organization must feel who has had
his faith shaken in the religion of his fathers. To such a
man the quarrel with his childhood's faith is a never-ending
anguish; especially is it so with a religion so objective,
so pictorial, and so interwoven with the whole physical and
nervous nature of man, as that which grew up and flowered
in modern Italy.</p>

<p>Agostino was like a man who lives in an eternal struggle
of self-justification,&mdash;his reason forever going over and
over with its plea before his regretful and never-satisfied
heart, which was drawn every hour of the day by some
chain of memory towards the faith whose visible administrators
he detested with the whole force of his moral being.
When the vesper-bell, with its plaintive call, rose amid
the purple shadows of the olive-silvered mountains,&mdash;when
the distant voices of chanting priest and choir reached him
solemnly from afar,&mdash;when he looked into a church with
its cloudy pictures of angels, and its window-panes flaming
with venerable forms of saints and martyrs,&mdash;it roused a
yearning anguish, a pain and conflict, which all the efforts
of his reason could not subdue. How to be a Christian
and yet defy the authorized Head of the Christian Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
or how to be a Christian and recognize foul men of obscene
and rapacious deeds as Christ's representatives, was the inextricable
Gordian knot, which his sword could not divide.
He dared not approach the Sacrament, he dared not pray,
and sometimes he felt wild impulses to tread down in riotous
despair every fragment of a religious belief which
seemed to live in his heart only to torture him. He had
heard priests scoff over the wafer they consecrated,&mdash;he
had known them to mingle poison for rivals in the sacramental
wine,&mdash;and yet God had kept silence and not
struck them dead; and like the Psalmist of old he said,
"Verily, I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed
my hands in innocency. Is there a God that judgeth in
the earth?"</p>

<p>The first time he saw Agnes bending like a flower in the
slanting evening sunbeams by the old gate of Sorrento,
while he stood looking down the kneeling street and striving
to hold his own soul in the sarcastic calm of utter
indifference, he felt himself struck to the heart by an influence
he could not define. The sight of that young face,
with its clear, beautiful lines, and its tender fervor, recalled
a thousand influences of the happiest and purest hours of
his life, and drew him with an attraction he vainly strove
to hide under an air of mocking gallantry.</p>

<p>When she looked him in the face with such grave, surprised
eyes of innocent confidence, and promised to pray
for him, he felt a remorseful tenderness as if he had
profaned a shrine. All that was passionate, poetic, and
romantic in his nature was awakened to blend itself in a
strange mingling of despairing sadness and of tender veneration
about this sweet image of perfect purity and faith.
Never does love strike so deep and immediate a root as in
a sorrowful and desolated nature; there it has nothing to
dispute the soil, and soon fills it with its interlacing fibres.</p>

<p>In this case it was not merely Agnes that he sighed for,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
but she stood to him as the fair symbol of that life-peace,
that rest of soul which he had lost, it seemed to him, forever.</p>

<p>"Behold this pure, believing child," he said to himself,&mdash;"a
true member of that blessed Church to which thou
art a rebel! How peacefully this lamb walketh the old
ways trodden by saints and martyrs, while thou art an infidel
and unbeliever!" And then a stern voice within
him answered, "What then? Is the Holy Ghost indeed
alone dispensed through the medium of Alexander and his
scarlet crew of cardinals? Hath the power to bind and
loose in Christ's Church been indeed given to whoever can
buy it with the wages of robbery and oppression? Why
does every prayer and pious word of the faithful reproach
me? Why is God silent? Or is there any God? Oh,
Agnes, Agnes! dear lily! fair lamb! lead a sinner into the
green pastures where thou restest!"</p>

<p>So wrestled the strong nature, tempest-tossed in its
strength,&mdash;so slept the trustful, blessed in its trust,&mdash;then
in Italy, as now in all lands.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE INTERVIEW</span></h2>

<p>The dreams of Agnes, on the night after her conversation
with the monk and her singular momentary interview
with the cavalier, were a strange mixture of images, indicating
the peculiarities of her education and habits of daily
thought.</p>

<p>She dreamed that she was sitting alone in the moonlight,
and heard some one rustling in the distant foliage of the
orange groves, and from them came a young man dressed
in white of a dazzling clearness like sunlight; large pearly
wings fell from his shoulders and seemed to shimmer with
a phosphoric radiance; his forehead was broad and grave,
and above it floated a thin, tremulous tongue of flame; his
eyes had that deep, mysterious gravity which is so well
expressed in all the Florentine paintings of celestial beings;
and yet, singularly enough, this white-robed, glorified form
seemed to have the features and lineaments of the mysterious
cavalier of the evening before,&mdash;the same deep, mournful
dark eyes, only that in them the light of earthly pride
had given place to the calm, strong gravity of an assured
peace,&mdash;the same broad forehead,&mdash;the same delicately
chiseled features, but elevated and etherealized, glowing
with a kind of interior ecstasy. He seemed to move from
the shadow of the orange trees with a backward floating
of his lustrous garments, as if borne on a cloud just along
the surface of the ground; and in his hand he held the
lily spray, all radiant with a silvery, living light, just as
the monk had suggested to her a divine flower might be.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
Agnes seemed to herself to hold her breath and marvel
with a secret awe, and as often happens in dreams, she
wondered to herself, "Was this stranger, then, indeed,
not even mortal, not even a king's brother, but an angel?
How strange," she said to herself, "that I should never
have seen it in his eyes!" Nearer and nearer the vision
drew, and touched her forehead with the lily, which seemed
dewy and icy cool; and with the contact it seemed to her
that a delicious tranquillity, a calm ecstasy, possessed her
soul, and the words were impressed in her mind, as if
spoken in her ear, "The Lord hath sealed thee for his
own!"&mdash;and then, with the wild fantasy of dreams, she
saw the cavalier in his wonted form and garments, just as
he had kneeled to her the night before, and he said, "Oh,
Agnes! Agnes! little lamb of Christ, love me and lead
me!"&mdash;and in her sleep it seemed to her that her heart
stirred and throbbed with a strange, new movement in answer
to those sad, pleading eyes, and thereafter her dream
became more troubled.</p>

<p>The sea was beginning now to brighten with the reflection
of the coming dawn in the sky, and the flickering fire
of Vesuvius was waxing sickly and pale; and while all the
high points of rocks were turning of a rosy purple, in the
weird depths of the gorge were yet the unbroken shadows
and stillness of night. But at the earliest peep of dawn
the monk had risen, and now, as he paced up and down
the little garden, his morning hymn mingled with Agnes's
dreams,&mdash;words strong with all the nerve of the old Latin,
which, when they were written, had scarcely ceased to be
the spoken tongue of Italy.</p>

<p>The hymn in every word well expressed the character
and habitual pose of mind of the singer, whose views of
earthly matters were as different from the views of ordinary
working mortals as those of a bird, as he flits and
perches and sings, must be from those of the four-footed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
ox who plods. The "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sobriam ebrietatem spiritus</i>" was
with him first constitutional, as a child of sunny skies, and
then cultivated by every employment and duty of the religious
and artistic career to which from childhood he had
devoted himself. If perfect, unalloyed happiness has ever
existed in this weary, work-day world of ours, it has been
in the bosoms of some of those old religious artists of the
Middle Ages, whose thoughts grew and flowered in prayerful
shadows, bursting into thousands of quaint and fanciful
blossoms on the pages of missal and breviary. In them
the fine life of color, form, and symmetry, which is the
gift of the Italian, formed a rich stock on which to graft
the true vine of religious faith, and rare and fervid were
the blossoms.</p>

<p>For it must be remarked in justice of the Christian religion,
that the Italian people never rose to the honors of
originality in the beautiful arts till inspired by Christianity.
The Art of ancient Rome was a second-hand copy of
the original and airy Greek,&mdash;often clever, but never vivid
and self-originating. It is to the religious Art of the
Middle Ages, to the Umbrian and Florentine schools particularly,
that we look for the peculiar and characteristic
flowering of the Italian mind. When the old Greek Art
revived again in modern Europe, though at first it seemed
to add richness and grace to this peculiar development, it
smothered and killed it at last, as some brilliant tropical
parasite exhausts the life of the tree it seems at first to
adorn. Raphael and Michel Angelo mark both the perfected
splendor and the commenced decline of original Italian
Art; and just in proportion as their ideas grew less
Christian and more Greek did the peculiar vividness and
intense flavor of Italian nationality pass away from them.
They became again like the ancient Romans, gigantic imitators
and clever copyists, instead of inspired kings and
priests of a national development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
The tones of the monk's morning hymn awakened
both Agnes and Elsie, and the latter was on the alert
instantly.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul!" she said, "brother Antonio has a
marvelous power of lungs; he is at it the first thing in the
morning. It always used to be so; when he was a boy, he
would wake me up before daylight singing."</p>

<p>"He is happy, like the birds," said Agnes, "because he
flies near heaven."</p>

<p>"Like enough: he was always a pious boy; his prayers
and his pencil were ever uppermost: but he was a poor
hand at work: he could draw you an olive-tree on paper;
but set him to dress it, and any fool would have done
better."</p>

<p>The morning rites of devotion and the simple repast
being over, Elsie prepared to go to her business. It had
occurred to her that the visit of her brother was an admirable
pretext for withdrawing Agnes from the scene of her
daily traffic, and of course, as she fondly supposed, keeping
her from the sight of the suspected admirer.</p>

<p>Neither Agnes nor the monk had disturbed her serenity
by recounting the adventure of the evening before. Agnes
had been silent from the habitual reserve which a difference
of nature ever placed between her and her grandmother,&mdash;a
difference which made confidence on her side
an utter impossibility. There are natures which ever must
be silent to other natures, because there is no common
language between them. In the same house, at the same
board, sharing the same pillow even, are those forever
strangers and foreigners, whose whole stock of intercourse
is limited to a few brief phrases on the commonest material
wants of life, and who, as soon as they try to go farther,
have no words that are mutually understood.</p>

<p>"Agnes," said her grandmother, "I shall not need you
at the stand to-day. There is that new flax to be spun,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
and you may keep company with your uncle. I'll warrant
me, you'll be glad enough of that!"</p>

<p>"Certainly I shall," said Agnes, cheerfully. "Uncle's
comings are my holidays."</p>

<p>"I will show you somewhat further on my Breviary,"
said the monk. "Praised be God, many new ideas sprang
up in my mind last night, and seemed to shoot forth in
blossoms. Even my dreams have often been made fruitful
in this divine work."</p>

<p>"Many a good thought comes in dreams," said Elsie;
"but, for my part, I work too hard and sleep too sound to
get much that way."</p>

<p>"Well, brother," said Elsie, after breakfast, "you must
look well after Agnes to-day; for there be plenty of wolves
go round, hunting these little lambs."</p>

<p>"Have no fear, sister," said the monk, tranquilly; "the
angels have her in charge. If our eyes were only clear-sighted,
we should see that Christ's little ones are never
alone."</p>

<p>"All that is fine talk, brother; but I never found that
the angels attended to any of my affairs, unless I looked
after them pretty sharp myself; and as for girls, the dear
Lord knows they need a legion apiece to look after them.
What with roystering fellows and smooth-tongued gallants,
and with silly, empty-headed hussies like that Giulietta,
one has much ado to keep the best of them straight. Agnes
is one of the best, too,&mdash;a well-brought up, pious, obedient
girl, and industrious as a bee. Happy is the husband who
gets her. I would I knew a man good enough for her."</p>

<p>This conversation took place while Agnes was in the
garden picking oranges and lemons, and filling the basket
which her grandmother was to take to the town. The silver
ripple of a hymn that she was singing came through
the open door; it was part of a sacred ballad in honor of
Saint <span class="locked">Agnes:&mdash;</span></p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>"Hear you now, sister," said the monk, "how the Lord
keeps the door of this maiden's heart? There is no fear of
her; and I much doubt, sister, whether you would do well
to interfere with the evident call this child hath to devote
herself wholly to the Lord."</p>

<p>"Oh, you talk, brother Antonio, who never had a child
in your life, and don't know how a mother's heart warms
towards her children and her children's children! The
saints, as I said, must be reasonable, and oughtn't to be
putting vocations into the head of an old woman's only
staff and stay; and if they oughtn't to, why, then, they
won't. Agnes is a pious child, and loves her prayers and
hymns; and so she will love her husband, one of these
days, as an honest woman should."</p>

<p>"But you know, sister, that the highest seats in Paradise
are reserved for the virgins who follow the Lamb."</p>

<p>"Maybe so," said Elsie, stiffly; "but the lower seats are
good enough for Agnes and me. For my part, I would
rather have a little comfort as I go along, and put up with
less in Paradise (may our dear Lady bring us safely there!)
say I."</p>

<p>So saying, Elsie raised the large, square basket of golden
fruit to her head, and turned her stately figure towards the
scene of her daily labors.</p>

<p>The monk seated himself on the garden wall, with his
portfolio by his side, and seemed busily sketching and
retouching some of his ideas. Agnes wound some silvery-white
flax round her distaff, and seated herself near him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
under an orange tree; and while her small fingers were
twisting the flax, her large, thoughtful eyes were wandering
off on the deep blue sea, pondering over and over the
strange events of the day before, and the dreams of the
night.</p>

<p>"Dear child," said the monk, "have you thought more
of what I said to you?"</p>

<p>A deep blush suffused her cheek as she <span class="locked">answered,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Yes, uncle; and I had a strange dream last night."</p>

<p>"A dream, my little heart? Come, then, and tell it to
its uncle. Dreams are the hushing of the bodily senses,
that the eyes of the Spirit may open."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Agnes, "I dreamed that I sat pondering
as I did last evening in the moonlight, and that an
angel came forth from the <span class="locked">trees"&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Indeed!" said the monk, looking up with interest;
"what form had he?"</p>

<p>"He was a young man, in dazzling white raiment, and
his eyes were deep as eternity; and over his forehead was
a silver flame, and he bore a lily-stalk in his hand, which
was like what you told of, with light in itself."</p>

<p>"That must have been the holy Gabriel," said the
monk, "the angel that came to our blessed Mother. Did
he say aught?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he touched my forehead with the lily, and a sort
of cool rest and peace went all through me, and he said,
'The Lord hath sealed thee for his own!'"</p>

<p>"Even so," said the monk, looking up, and crossing
himself devoutly, "by this token I know that my prayers
are answered."</p>

<p>"But, dear uncle," said Agnes, hesitating and blushing
painfully, "there was one singular thing about my dream,&mdash;this
holy angel had yet a strange likeness to the young
man that came here last night, so that I could not but
marvel at it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
"It may be that the holy angel took on him in part this
likeness to show how glorious a redeemed soul might become,
that you might be encouraged to pray. The holy
Saint Monica thus saw the blessed Augustine standing
clothed in white among the angels while he was yet a
worldling and unbeliever, and thereby received the grace
to continue her prayers for thirty years, till she saw him
a holy bishop. This is a sure sign that this young man,
whoever he may be, shall attain Paradise through your
prayers. Tell me, dear little heart, is this the first angel
thou hast seen?"</p>

<p>"I never dreamed of them before. I have dreamed of
our Lady, and Saint Agnes, and Saint Catharine of Siena,
and sometimes it seemed that they sat a long time by my
bed, and sometimes it seemed that they took me with them
away to some beautiful place where the air was full of
music, and sometimes they filled my hands with such lovely
flowers that when I waked I was ready to weep that they
could no more be found. Why, dear uncle, do <i>you</i> see
angels often?"</p>

<p>"Not often, dear child, but sometimes a little glimpse.
But you should see the pictures of our holy Father Angelico,
to whom the angels appeared constantly; for so
blessed was the life he lived, that it was more in heaven
than on earth. He would never cumber his mind with the
things of this world, and would not paint for money, nor
for princes' favor; nor would he take places of power and
trust in the Church, or else, so great was his piety, they
had made a bishop of him; but he kept ever aloof and
walked in the shade. He used to say, 'They that would
do Christ's work must walk with Christ.' His pictures of
angels are indeed wonderful, and their robes are of all dazzling
colors, like the rainbow. It is most surely believed
among us that he painted to show forth what he saw in
heavenly visions."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
"Ah!" said Agnes, "how I wish I could see some of
these things!"</p>

<p>"You may well say so, dear child. There is one picture
of Paradise painted on gold, and there you may see
our Lord in the midst of the heavens crowning his blessed
Mother, and all the saints and angels surrounding; and the
colors are so bright that they seem like the sunset clouds,&mdash;golden,
and rosy, and purple, and amethystine, and
green like the new, tender leaves of spring: for, you see,
the angels are the Lord's flowers and birds that shine and
sing to gladden his Paradise, and there is nothing bright
on earth that is comparable to them,&mdash;so said the blessed
Angelico, who saw them. And what seems worthy of note
about them is their marvelous lightness, that they seem to
float as naturally as the clouds do, and their garments have
a divine grace of motion like vapor that curls and wavers
in the sun. Their faces, too, are most wonderful; for
they seem so full of purity and majesty, and withal humble,
with an inexpressible sweetness; for, beyond all others
it was given to the holy Angelico to paint the immortal
beauty of the soul."</p>

<p>"It must be a great blessing and favor for you, dear
uncle, to see all these things," said Agnes; "I am never
tired of hearing you tell of them."</p>

<p>"There is one little picture," said the monk, "wherein
he hath painted the death of our dear Lady; and surely no
mortal could ever conceive anything like her sweet dying
face, so faint and weak and tender that each man sees his
own mother dying there, yet so holy that one feels that it
can be no other than the mother of our Lord; and around
her stand the disciples mourning; but above is our blessed
Lord himself, who receives the parting spirit, as a tender
new-born babe, into his bosom: for so the holy painters
represented the death of saints, as of a birth in which each
soul became a little child of heaven."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
"How great grace must come from such pictures!" said
Agnes. "It seems to me that the making of such holy
things is one of the most blessed of good works. Dear
uncle," she said, after a pause, "they say that this deep
gorge is haunted by evil spirits, who often waylay and bewilder
the unwary, especially in the hours of darkness."</p>

<p>"I should not wonder in the least," said the monk;
"for you must know, child, that our beautiful Italy was of
old so completely given up and gone over to idolatry that
even her very soil casts up fragments of temples and stones
that have been polluted. Especially around these shores
there is scarcely a spot that hath not been violated in all
times by vilenesses and impurities such as the Apostle saith
it is a shame even to speak of. These very waters cast up
marbles and fragments of colored mosaics from the halls
which were polluted with devil-worship and abominable
revelings; so that, as the Gospel saith that the evil spirits
cast out by Christ walk through waste places, so do they
cling to these fragments of their old estate."</p>

<p>"Well, uncle, I have longed to consecrate the gorge to
Christ by having a shrine there, where I might keep a lamp
burning."</p>

<p>"It is a most pious thought, child."</p>

<p>"And so, dear uncle, I thought that you would undertake
the work. There is one Pietro hereabout who is a
skillful worker in stone, and was a playfellow of mine,&mdash;though
of late grandmamma has forbidden me to talk with
him,&mdash;and I think he would execute it under your direction."</p>

<p>"Indeed, my little heart, it shall be done," said the
monk, cheerfully; "and I will engage to paint a fair picture
of our Lady to be within; and I think it would be a
good thought to have a pinnacle on the outside, where
should stand a statue of Saint Michael with his sword.
Saint Michael is a brave and wonderful angel, and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
devils and vile spirits are afraid of him. I will set about
the devices to-day." And cheerily the good monk began
to intone a verse of an old <span class="locked">hymn,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In such talk and work the day passed to Agnes; but we
will not say that she did not often fall into deep musings
on the mysterious visitor of the night before. Often while
the good monk was busy at his drawing, the distaff would
droop over her knee and her large dark eyes become intently
fixed on the ground, as if she were pondering some
absorbing subject.</p>

<p>Little could her literal, hard-working grandmother, or
her artistic, simple-minded uncle, or the dreamy Mother
Theresa, or her austere confessor, know of the strange
forcing process which they were all together uniting to carry
on in the mind of this sensitive young girl. Absolutely
secluded by her grandmother's watchful care from any
actual knowledge and experience of real life, she had no
practical tests by which to correct the dreams of that inner
world in which she delighted to live and move, and which
was peopled with martyrs, saints, and angels, whose deeds
were possible or probable only in the most exalted regions
of devout poetry.</p>

<p>So she gave her heart at once and without reserve to an
enthusiastic desire for the salvation of the stranger, whom
Heaven, she believed, had directed to seek her intercessions;
and when the spindle drooped from her hand, and
her eyes became fixed on vacancy, she found herself wondering
who he might really be, and longing to know yet a
little more of him.</p>

<p>Towards the latter part of the afternoon, a hasty messenger
came to summon her uncle to administer the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
rites to a man who had just fallen from a building, and
who, it was feared, might breathe his last unshriven.</p>

<p>"Dear daughter, I must hasten and carry Christ to this
poor sinner," said the monk, hastily putting all his sketches
and pencils into her lap. "Have a care of these till I
return,&mdash;that is my good little one!"</p>

<p>Agnes carefully arranged the sketches and put them into
the book, and then, kneeling before the shrine, began
prayers for the soul of the dying man.</p>

<p>She prayed long and fervently, and so absorbed did she
become, that she neither saw nor heard anything that passed
around her.</p>

<p>It was therefore with a start of surprise, as she rose
from prayer, that she saw the cavalier sitting on one end
of the marble sarcophagus, with an air so composed and
melancholy that he might have been taken for one of the
marble knights that sometimes are found on tombs.</p>

<p>"You are surprised to see me, dear Agnes," he said,
with a calm, slow utterance, like a man who has assumed
a position he means fully to justify; "but I have watched
day and night, ever since I saw you, to find one moment
to speak with you alone."</p>

<p>"My Lord," said Agnes, "I humbly wait your pleasure.
Anything that a poor maiden may rightly do, I will endeavor,
in all loving duty."</p>

<p>"Whom do you take me for, Agnes, that you speak
thus?" said the cavalier, smiling sadly.</p>

<p>"Are you not the brother of our gracious King?" said
Agnes.</p>

<p>"No, dear maiden; and if the kind promise you lately
made me is founded on this mistake, it may be retracted."</p>

<p>"No, my Lord," said Agnes, "though I now know not
who you are, yet if in any strait or need you seek such
poor prayers as mine, God forbid I should refuse them!"</p>

<p>"I am, indeed, in strait and need, Agnes; the sun does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
not shine on a more desolate man than I am,&mdash;one more
utterly alone in the world; there is no one left to love me.
Agnes, can you not love me a little?&mdash;let it be ever so
little, it shall content me."</p>

<p>It was the first time that words of this purport had ever
been addressed to Agnes; but they were said so simply, so
sadly, so tenderly, that they somehow seemed to her the
most natural and proper things in the world to be said;
and this poor handsome knight, who looked so earnest and
sorrowful,&mdash;how could she help answering, "Yes"?
From her cradle she had always loved everybody and everything,
and why should an exception be made in behalf of
a very handsome, very strong, yet very gentle and submissive
human being, who came and knocked so humbly at
the door of her heart? Neither Mary nor the saints had
taught her to be hard-hearted.</p>

<p>"Yes, my Lord," she said, "you may believe that I will
love and pray for you; but now, you must leave me, and
not come here any more, because grandmamma would not
be willing that I should talk with you, and it would be
wrong to disobey her, she is so very good to me."</p>

<p>"But, dear Agnes," began the cavalier, approaching her,
"I have many things to say to you,&mdash;I have much to tell
you."</p>

<p>"But I know grandmamma would not be willing," said
Agnes; "indeed you must not come here any more."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said the stranger, "at least you will meet
me at some time,&mdash;tell me only where."</p>

<p>"I cannot,&mdash;indeed I cannot," said Agnes, distressed
and embarrassed. "Even now, if grandmamma knew you
were here, she would be so angry."</p>

<p>"But how can you pray for me, when you know nothing
of me?"</p>

<p>"The dear Lord knoweth you," said Agnes; "and when
I speak of you, He will know what you need."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
"Ah, dear child, how fervent is your faith! Alas for
me! I have lost the power of prayer! I have lost the believing
heart my mother gave me,&mdash;my dear mother who
is now in heaven."</p>

<p>"Ah, how can that be?" said Agnes. "Who could
lose faith in so dear a Lord as ours, and so loving a mother?"</p>

<p>"Agnes, dear little lamb, you know nothing of the
world; and I should be most wicked to disturb your lovely
peace of soul with any sinful doubts. Oh, Agnes, Agnes,
I am most miserable, most unworthy!"</p>

<p>"Dear sir, should you not cleanse your soul by the holy
sacrament of confession, and receive the living Christ within
you? For he says, 'Without me ye can do nothing.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, Agnes, sacrament and prayer are not for such as
me! It is only through your pure prayers I can hope for
grace."</p>

<p>"Dear sir, I have an uncle, a most holy man, and gentle
as a lamb. He is of the convent San Marco in Florence,
where there is a most holy prophet risen up."</p>

<p>"Savonarola?" said the cavalier, with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is he. You should hear my uncle talk of
him, and how blessed his preaching has been to many
souls. Dear sir, come sometime to my uncle."</p>

<p>At this moment the sound of Elsie's voice was heard
ascending the path to the gorge outside, talking with Father
Antonio, who was returning.</p>

<p>Both started, and Agnes looked alarmed.</p>

<p>"Fear nothing, sweet lamb," said the cavalier; "I am
gone."</p>

<p>He kneeled and kissed the hand of Agnes, and disappeared
at one bound over the parapet on the side opposite
that which they were approaching.</p>

<p>Agnes hastily composed herself, struggling with that
half-guilty feeling which is apt to weigh on a conscientious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
nature that has been unwittingly drawn to act a part which
would be disapproved by those whose good opinion it habitually
seeks. The interview had but the more increased
her curiosity to know the history of this handsome stranger.
Who, then, could he be? What were his troubles? She
wished the interview could have been long enough to satisfy
her mind on these points. From the richness of his
dress, from his air and manner, from the poetry and the
jewel that accompanied it, she felt satisfied that, if not
what she supposed, he was at least nobly born, and had
shone in some splendid sphere whose habits and ways were
far beyond her simple experiences. She felt towards him
somewhat of the awe which a person of her condition in
life naturally felt toward that brilliant aristocracy which in
those days assumed the state of princes, and the members
of which were supposed to look down on common mortals
from as great a height as the stars regard the humblest
flowers of the field.</p>

<p>"How strange," she thought, "that he should think so
much of me! What can he see in me? And how can it
be that a great lord, who speaks so gently and is so reverential
to a poor girl, and asks prayers so humbly, can be so
wicked and unbelieving as he says he is? Dear God, it
cannot be that he is an unbeliever; the great Enemy has
been permitted to try him, to suggest doubts to him, as he
has to holy saints before now. How beautifully he spoke
about his mother!&mdash;tears glittered in his eyes then,&mdash;ah,
there must be grace there after all!"</p>

<p>"Well, my little heart," said Elsie, interrupting her
reveries, "have you had a pleasant day?"</p>

<p>"Delightful, grandmamma," said Agnes, blushing deeply
with consciousness.</p>

<p>"Well," said Elsie, with satisfaction, "one thing I know,&mdash;I've
frightened off that old hawk of a cavalier with his
hooked nose. I haven't seen so much as the tip of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
shoe-tie to-day. Yesterday he made himself very busy
around our stall; but I made him understand that you
never would come there again till the coast was clear."</p>

<p>The monk was busily retouching the sketch of the Virgin
of the Annunciation. He looked up, and saw Agnes standing
gazing towards the setting sun, the pale olive of her
cheek deepening into a crimson flush. His head was too
full of his own work to give much heed to the conversation
that had passed, but, looking at the glowing face, he said
to <span class="locked">himself,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Truly, sometimes she might pass for the rose of Sharon
as well as the lily of the valley!"</p>

<p>The moon that evening rose an hour later than the night
before, yet found Agnes still on her knees before the sacred
shrine, while Elsie, tired, grumbled at the draft on her
sleeping-time.</p>

<p>"Enough is as good as a feast," she remarked between
her teeth; still she had, after all, too much secret reverence
for her grandchild's piety openly to interrupt her. But in
those days, as now, there were the material and the spiritual,
the souls who looked only on things that could be
seen, touched, and tasted, and souls who looked on the
things that were invisible.</p>

<p>Agnes was pouring out her soul in that kind of yearning,
passionate prayer possible to intensely sympathetic people,
in which the interests and wants of another seem to annihilate
for a time personal consciousness, and make the whole
of one's being seem to dissolve in an intense solicitude for
something beyond one's self. In such hours prayer ceases
to be an act of the will, and resembles more some overpowering
influence which floods the soul from without,
bearing all its faculties away on its resistless tide.</p>

<p>Brought up from infancy to feel herself in a constant
circle of invisible spiritual agencies, Agnes received this
wave of intense feeling as an impulse inspired and breathed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
into her by some celestial spirit, that thus she should be
made an interceding medium for a soul in some unknown
strait or peril. For her faith taught her to believe in an
infinite struggle of intercession in which all the Church
Visible and Invisible were together engaged, and which
bound them in living bonds of sympathy to an interceding
Redeemer, so that there was no want or woe of human life
that had not somewhere its sympathetic heart, and its
never-ceasing prayer before the throne of Eternal Love.
Whatever may be thought of the actual truth of this belief,
it certainly was far more consoling than that intense individualism
of modern philosophy, which places every soul
alone in its life-battle, scarce even giving it a God to lean
upon.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CONFESSIONAL</span></h2>

<p>The reader, if a person of any common knowledge of
human nature, will easily see the direction in which a
young, inexperienced, and impressible girl would naturally
be tending under all the influences which we perceive to
have come upon her.</p>

<p>But in the religious faith which Agnes professed there
was a modifying force, whose power both for good and evil
can scarcely be estimated.</p>

<p>The simple Apostolic direction, "Confess your faults one
to another," and the very natural need of personal pastoral
guidance and assistance to a soul in its heavenward journey,
had in common with many other religious ideas been
forced by the volcanic fervor of the Italian nature into
a certain exaggerated proposition. Instead of brotherly
confession one to another, or the pastoral sympathy of a
fatherly elder, the religious mind of the day was instructed
in an awful mysterious sacrament of confession, which gave
to some human being a divine right to unlock the most
secret chambers of the soul, to scrutinize and direct its
most veiled and intimate thoughts, and, standing in God's
stead, to direct the current of its most sensitive and most
mysterious emotions.</p>

<p>Every young aspirant for perfection in the religious life
had to commence by an unreserved surrender of the whole
being in blind faith at the feet of some such spiritual director,
all whose questions must be answered, and all whose
injunctions obeyed, as from God himself. Thenceforward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
was to be no soul-privacy, no retirement, nothing too sacred
to be expressed, too delicate to be handled and analyzed.
In reading the lives of those ethereally made and moulded
women who have come down to our day canonized as saints
in the Roman Catholic communion, one too frequently gets
the impression of most regal natures, gifted with all the
most divine elements of humanity, but subjected to a constant
unnatural pressure from the ceaseless scrutiny and
ungenial pertinacity of some inferior and uncomprehending
person invested with the authority of a Spiritual Director.</p>

<p>That there are advantages attending this species of intimate
direction, when wisely and skillfully managed, cannot
be doubted. Groveling and imperfect natures have often
thus been lifted up and carried in the arms of superior wisdom
and purity. The confession administered by a Fénelon
or a Francis de Sales was doubtless a beautiful and most
invigorating ordinance; but the difficulty in its actual working
is the rarity of such superior natures,&mdash;the fact that
the most ignorant and most incapable may be invested with
precisely the same authority as the most intelligent and
skillful.</p>

<p>He to whom the faith of Agnes obliged her to lay open
her whole soul, who had a right with probing-knife and
lancet to dissect all the finest nerves and fibres of her
womanly nature, was a man who had been through all the
wild and desolating experiences incident to a dissipated and
irregular life in those turbulent days.</p>

<p>It is true that he was now with most stringent and earnest
solemnity striving to bring every thought and passion
into captivity to the spirit of his sacred vows; but still,
when a man has once lost that unconscious soul-purity
which exists in a mind unscathed by the fires of passion,
no after-tears can weep it back again. No penance, no
prayer, no anguish of remorse can give back the simplicity
of a soul that has never been stained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Il Padre Francesco had not failed to make those inquiries
into the character of Agnes's mysterious lover which he
assumed to be necessary as a matter of pastoral faithfulness.</p>

<p>It was not difficult for one possessing the secrets of the
confessional to learn the real character of any person in the
neighborhood, and it was with a kind of bitter satisfaction
which rather surprised himself that the father learned
enough ill of the cavalier to justify his using every possible
measure to prevent his forming any acquaintance with
Agnes. He was captain of a band of brigands, and, of
course, in array against the State; he was excommunicated,
and, of course, an enemy of the Church. What but the
vilest designs could be attributed to such a man? Was he
not a wolf prowling round the green, secluded pastures
where as yet the Lord's lamb had been folded in unconscious
innocence?</p>

<p>Father Francesco, when he next met Agnes at the confessional,
put such questions as drew from her the whole
account of all that had passed between her and the stranger.
The recital on Agnes's part was perfectly translucent and
pure, for she had said no word and had had no thought
that brought the slightest stain upon her soul. Love and
prayer had been the prevailing habit of her life, and in
promising to love and pray, she had had no worldly or
earthly thought. The language of gallantry, or even of
sincere passion, had never reached her ear; but it had
always been as natural to her to love every human being
as for a plant with tendrils to throw them round the next
plant, and therefore she entertained the gentle guest who
had lately found room in her heart without a question or
a scruple.</p>

<p>As Agnes related her childlike story of unconscious faith
and love, her listener felt himself strangely and bitterly
agitated. It was a vision of ignorant purity and unconsciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
rising before him, airy and glowing as a child's
soap-bubble, which one touch might annihilate; but he
felt a strange remorseful tenderness, a yearning admiration,
at its unsubstantial purity. There is something pleading
and pitiful in the simplicity of perfect ignorance,&mdash;a rare
and delicate beauty in its freshness, like the morning-glory
cup, which, once withered by the heat, no second morning
can restore. Agnes had imparted to her confessor, by a
mysterious sympathy, something like the morning freshness
of her own soul; she had redeemed the idea of womanhood
from gross associations, and set before him a fair ideal
of all that female tenderness and purity may teach to man.
Her prayers,&mdash;well he believed in them,&mdash;but he set his
teeth with a strange spasm of inward passion, when he
thought of her prayers and love being given to another.
He tried to persuade himself that this was only the fervor
of pastoral zeal against a vile robber who had seized the
fairest lamb of the sheepfold; but there was an intensely
bitter, miserable feeling connected with it, that scorched
and burned his higher aspirations like a stream of lava running
among fresh leaves and flowers.</p>

<p>The conflict of his soul communicated a severity of earnestness
to his voice and manner which made Agnes tremble,
as he put one probing question after another, designed
to awaken some consciousness of sin in her soul. Still,
though troubled and distressed by his apparent disapprobation,
her answers came always clear, honest, unfaltering,
like those of one who <i>could</i> not form an idea of evil.</p>

<p>When the confession was over, he came out of his recess
to speak with Agnes a few words face to face. His eyes
had a wild and haggard earnestness, and a vivid hectic
flush on either cheek told how extreme was his emotion.
Agnes lifted her eyes to his with an innocent wondering
trouble and an appealing confidence that for a moment
wholly unnerved him. He felt a wild impulse to clasp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
her in his arms; and for a moment it seemed to him he
would sacrifice heaven and brave hell, if he could for one
moment hold her to his heart, and say that he loved her,&mdash;her,
the purest, fairest, sweetest revelation of God's
love that had ever shone on his soul,&mdash;her, the only star,
the only flower, the only dewdrop of a burning, barren,
weary life. It seemed to him that it was not the longing,
gross passion, but the outcry of his whole nature for something
noble, sweet, and divine.</p>

<p>But he turned suddenly away with a sort of groan, and,
folding his robe over his face, seemed engaged in earnest
prayer. Agnes looked at him awestruck and breathless.</p>

<p>"Oh, my father!" she faltered, "what have I done?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, my poor child," said the father, suddenly
turning toward her with recovered calmness and dignity;
"but I behold in thee a fair lamb whom the roaring lion is
seeking to devour. Know, my daughter, that I have made
inquiries concerning this man of whom you speak, and find
that he is an outlaw and a robber and a heretic,&mdash;a vile
wretch stained by crimes that have justly drawn down
upon him the sentence of excommunication from our Holy
Father, the Pope."</p>

<p>Agnes grew deadly pale at this announcement.</p>

<p>"Can it be possible?" she gasped. "Alas! what dreadful
temptations have driven him to such sins?"</p>

<p>"Daughter, beware how you think too lightly of them,
or suffer his good looks and flattering words to blind you
to their horror. You must from your heart detest him as
a vile enemy."</p>

<p>"Must I, my father?"</p>

<p>"Indeed you must."</p>

<p>"But if the dear Lord loved us and died for us when
we were his enemies, may we not pity and pray for unbelievers?
Oh, say, my dear father, is it not allowed to us
to pray for all sinners, even the vilest?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
"I do not say that you may not, my daughter," said the
monk, too conscientious to resist the force of this direct
appeal; "but, daughter," he added, with an energy that
alarmed Agnes, "you must watch your heart; you must
not suffer your interest to become a worldly love: remember
that you are chosen to be the espoused of Christ
alone."</p>

<p>While the monk was speaking thus, Agnes fixed on him
her eyes with an innocent mixture of surprise and perplexity,
which gradually deepened into a strong gravity of gaze,
as if she were looking through him, through all visible
things, into some far-off depth of mysterious knowledge.</p>

<p>"My Lord will keep me," she said; "my soul is safe in
His heart as a little bird in its nest; but while I love Him,
I cannot help loving everybody whom He loves, even His
enemies: and, father, my heart prays within me for this
poor sinner, whether I will or no; something within me
continually intercedes for him."</p>

<p>"Oh, Agnes! Agnes! blessed child, pray for me also,"
said the monk, with a sudden burst of emotion which perfectly
confounded his disciple. He hid his face with his
hands.</p>

<p>"My blessed father!" said Agnes, "how could I deem
that holiness like yours had any need of my prayers?"</p>

<p>"Child! child! you know nothing of me. I am a miserable
sinner, tempted of devils, in danger of damnation."</p>

<p>Agnes stood appalled at this sudden burst, so different
from the rigid and restrained severity of tone in which the
greater part of the conversation had been conducted. She
stood silent and troubled; while he, whom she had always
regarded with such awful veneration, seemed shaken by
some internal whirlwind of emotion whose nature she could
not comprehend.</p>

<p>At length Father Francesco raised his head, and recovered
his wonted calm severity of expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
"My daughter," he said, "little do the innocent lambs
of the flock know of the dangers and conflicts through
which the shepherds must pass who keep the Lord's fold.
We have the labors of angels laid upon us, and we are but
men. Often we stumble, often we faint, and Satan takes
advantage of our weakness. I cannot confer with you now
as I would; but, my child, listen to my directions. Shun
this young man; let nothing ever lead you to listen to
another word from him; you must not even look at him,
should you meet, but turn away your head and repeat a
prayer. I do not forbid you to practice the holy work of
intercession for his soul, but it must be on these conditions."</p>

<p>"My father," said Agnes, "you may rely on my obedience;"
and, kneeling, she kissed his hand.</p>

<p>He drew it suddenly away, with a gesture of pain and
displeasure.</p>

<p>"Pardon a sinful child this liberty," said Agnes.</p>

<p>"You know not what you do," said the father, hastily.
"Go, my daughter,&mdash;go at once; I will confer with you
some other time;" and hastily raising his hand in an attitude
of benediction, he turned and went into the confessional.</p>

<p>"Wretch! hypocrite! whited sepulchre!" he said to
himself,&mdash;"to warn this innocent child against a sin that
is all the while burning in my own bosom! Yes, I do
love her,&mdash;I do! I, that warn her against earthly love,
I would plunge into hell itself to win hers! And yet,
when I know that the care of her soul is only a temptation
and a snare to me, I cannot, will not give her up!
No, I cannot!&mdash;no, I will not! Why should I not love
her? Is she not pure as Mary herself? Ah, blessed is he
whom such a woman leads! And I&mdash;I&mdash;have condemned
myself to the society of swinish, ignorant, stupid monks,&mdash;I
must know no such divine souls, no such sweet communion!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
Help me, blessed Mary!&mdash;help a miserable
sinner!"</p>

<p>Agnes left the confessional perplexed and sorrowful.
The pale, proud, serious face of the cavalier seemed to
look at her imploringly, and she thought of him now with
the pathetic interest we give to something noble and great
exposed to some fatal danger. "Could the sacrifice of my
whole life," she thought, "rescue this noble soul from
perdition, then I shall not have lived in vain. I am a
poor little girl; nobody knows whether I live or die. He
is a strong and powerful man, and many must stand or fall
with him. Blessed be the Lord that gives to his lowly
ones a power to work in secret places! How blessed
should I be to meet him in Paradise all splendid as I saw
him in my dream! Oh, that would be worth living for,&mdash;worth
dying for!"</p>

<span class="smaller">PERPLEXITIES</span></h2>

<p>Agnes returned from the confessional with more sadness
than her simple life had ever known before. The agitation
of her confessor, the tremulous eagerness of his words,
the alternations of severity and tenderness in his manner
to her, all struck her only as indications of the very grave
danger in which she was placed, and the awfulness of the
sin and condemnation which oppressed the soul of one for
whom she was conscious of a deep and strange interest.</p>

<p>She had the undoubting, uninquiring reverence which
a Christianly educated child of those times might entertain
for the visible head of the Christian Church, all whose
doings were to be regarded with an awful veneration which
never even raised a question.</p>

<p>That the Papal throne was now filled by a man who had
bought his election with the wages of iniquity, and dispensed
its powers and offices with sole reference to the
aggrandizement of a family proverbial for brutality and
obscenity, was a fact well known to the reasoning and
enlightened orders of society at this time; but it did not
penetrate into those lowly valleys where the sheep of the
Lord humbly pastured, innocently unconscious of the frauds
and violence by which their dearest interests were bought
and sold.</p>

<p>The Christian faith we now hold, who boast our enlightened
Protestantism, has been transmitted to us through the
hearts and hands of such,&mdash;who, while princes wrangled
with Pope, and Pope with princes, knew nothing of it all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
but in lowly ways of prayer and patient labor were one
with us of modern times in the great central belief of the
Christian heart, "Worthy is the Lamb that was slain."</p>

<p>As Agnes came slowly up the path towards the little
garden, she was conscious of a burden and weariness of
spirit she had never known before. She passed the little
moist grotto, which in former times she never failed to
visit to see if there were any new-blown cyclamen, without
giving it even a thought. A crimson spray of gladiolus
leaned from the rock and seemed softly to kiss her cheek,
yet she regarded it not; and once stopping and gazing
abstractedly upward on the flower-tapestried walls of the
gorge, as they rose in wreath and garland and festoon above
her, she felt as if the brilliant yellow of the broom and the
crimson of the gillyflowers, and all the fluttering, nodding
armies of brightness that were dancing in the sunlight,
were too gay for such a world as this, where mortal sins
and sorrows made such havoc with all that seemed brightest
and best, and she longed to fly away and be at rest.</p>

<p>Just then she heard the cheerful voice of her uncle in
the little garden above, as he was singing at his painting.
The words were those of that old Latin hymn of Saint
Bernard, which, in its English dress, has thrilled many a
Methodist class meeting and many a Puritan conference,
telling, in the welcome they meet in each Christian soul,
that there is a unity in Christ's Church which is not outward,&mdash;a
secret, invisible bond, by which, under warring
names and badges of opposition, His true followers have
yet been one in Him, even though they discerned it not.</p>

<p>The old monk sang with all his heart; and his voice,
which had been a fine one in its day, had still that power
which comes from the expression of deep feeling. One
often hears this peculiarity in the voices of persons of genius
and sensibility, even when destitute of any real critical
merit. They seem to be so interfused with the emotions
of the soul, that they strike upon the heart almost like the
living touch of a spirit.</p>

<p>Agnes was soothed in listening to him. The Latin
words, the sentiment of which had been traditional in the
Church from time immemorial, had to her a sacred fragrance
and odor; they were words apart from all common
usage, a sacramental language, never heard but in moments
of devotion and aspiration,&mdash;and they stilled the child's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
heart in its tossings and tempest, as when of old the Jesus
they spake of walked forth on the stormy sea.</p>

reigning for us!</p>

<p>"What, my little one!" said the monk, looking over the
wall; "I thought I heard angels singing. Is it not a beautiful
morning?"</p>

<p>"Dear uncle, it is," said Agnes. "And I have been so
glad to hear your beautiful hymn!&mdash;it comforted me."</p>

<p>"Comforted you, little heart? What a word is that!
When you get as far along on your journey as your old
uncle, then you may talk of comfort. But who thinks of
comforting birds or butterflies or young lambs?"</p>

<p>"Ah, dear uncle, I am not so very happy," said Agnes,
the tears starting into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Not happy?" said the monk, looking up from his
drawing. "Pray, what's the matter now? Has a bee
stung your finger? or have you lost your nosegay over a
rock? or what dreadful affliction has come upon you?&mdash;hey,
my little heart?"</p>

<p>Agnes sat down on the corner of the marble fountain,
and, covering her face with her apron, sobbed as if her
heart would break.</p>

<p>"What has that old priest been saying to her in the confession?"
said Father Antonio to himself. "I dare say he
cannot understand her. She is as pure as a dewdrop on a
cobweb, and as delicate; and these priests, half of them,
don't know how to handle the Lord's lambs. Come now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
little Agnes," he said, with a coaxing tone, "what is its
trouble?&mdash;tell its old uncle,&mdash;there's a dear!"</p>

<p>"Ah, uncle, I can't!" said Agnes, between her sobs.</p>

<p>"Can't tell its uncle!&mdash;there's a pretty go! Perhaps
you will tell grandmamma?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, no! not for the world!" said Agnes, sobbing
still more bitterly.</p>

<p>"Why, really, little heart of mine, this is getting serious,"
said the monk; "let your old uncle try to help you."</p>

<p>"It isn't for myself," said Agnes, endeavoring to check
her feelings,&mdash;"it is not for myself,&mdash;it is for another,&mdash;for
a soul lost. Ah, my Jesus, have mercy!"</p>

<p>"A soul lost? Our Mother forbid!" said the monk,
crossing himself. "Lost in this Christian land, so overflowing
with the beauty of the Lord?&mdash;lost out of this fair
sheepfold of Paradise?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lost," said Agnes, despairingly, "and if somebody
do not save him, lost forever; and it is a brave and
noble soul, too,&mdash;like one of the angels that fell."</p>

<p>"Who is it, dear?&mdash;tell me about it," said the monk.
"I am one of the shepherds whose place it is to go after
that which is lost, even till I find it."</p>

<p>"Dear uncle, you remember the youth who suddenly
appeared to us in the moonlight here a few evenings ago?"</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed!" said the monk, "what of him?"</p>

<p>"Father Francesco has told me dreadful things of him
this morning."</p>

<p>"What things?"</p>

<p>"Uncle, he is excommunicated by our Holy Father the
Pope."</p>

<p>Father Antonio, as a member of one of the most enlightened
and cultivated religious orders of the times, and as an
intimate companion and disciple of Savonarola, had a full
understanding of the character of the reigning Pope, and
therefore had his own private opinion of how much his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
excommunication was likely to be worth in the invisible
world. He knew that the same doom had been threatened
towards his saintly master, for opposing and exposing the
scandalous vices which disgraced the high places of the
Church; so that, on the whole, when he heard that this
young man was excommunicated, so far from being impressed
with horror towards him, he conceived the idea
that he might be a particularly honest fellow and good
Christian. But then he did not hold it wise to disturb the
faith of the simple-hearted by revealing to them the truth
about the head of the Church on earth.</p>

<p>While the disorders in those elevated regions filled the
minds of the intelligent classes with apprehension and
alarm, they held it unwise to disturb the trustful simplicity
of the lower orders, whose faith in Christianity itself they
supposed might thus be shaken. In fact, they were themselves
somewhat puzzled how to reconcile the patent and
manifest fact, that the actual incumbent of the Holy See
was not under the guidance of any spirit, unless it were
a diabolical one, with the theory which supposed an infallible
guidance of the Holy Spirit to attend as a matter of
course on that position. Some of the boldest of them did
not hesitate to declare that the Holy City had suffered a
foul invasion, and that a false usurper reigned in her sacred
palaces in place of the Father of Christendom. The greater
part did as people now do with the mysteries and discrepancies
of a faith which on the whole they revere: they
turned their attention from the vexed question, and sighed
and longed for better days.</p>

<p>Father Antonio did not, therefore, tell Agnes that the
announcement which had filled her with such distress was
far less conclusive with himself of the ill desert of the individual
to whom it related.</p>

<p>"My little heart," he answered, gravely, "did you learn
the sin for which this young man was excommunicated?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
"Ah, me! my dear uncle, I fear he is an infidel,&mdash;an
unbeliever. Indeed, now I remember it, he confessed as
much to me the other day."</p>

<p>"Where did he tell you this?"</p>

<p>"You remember, my uncle, when you were sent for to
the dying man? When you were gone, I kneeled down
to pray for his soul; and when I rose from prayer, this
young cavalier was sitting right here, on this end of the
fountain. He was looking fixedly at me, with such sad
eyes, so full of longing and pain, that it was quite piteous;
and he spoke to me so sadly, I could not but pity him."</p>

<p>"What did he say to you, child?"</p>

<p>"Ah, father, he said that he was all alone in the world,
without friends, and utterly desolate, with no one to love
him; but worse than that, he said he had lost his faith,
that he could not believe."</p>

<p>"What did you say to him?"</p>

<p>"Uncle, I tried, as a poor girl might, to do him some
good. I prayed him to confess and take the sacrament; but
he looked almost fierce when I said so. And yet I cannot
but think, after all, that he has not lost all grace, because
he begged me so earnestly to pray for him; he said his
prayers could do no good, and wanted mine. And then
I began to tell him about you, dear uncle, and how you
came from that blessed convent in Florence, and about your
master Savonarola; and that seemed to interest him, for he
looked quite excited, and spoke the name over, as if it
were one he had heard before. I wanted to urge him to
come and open his case to you; and I think perhaps I
might have succeeded, but that just then you and grandmamma
came up the path; and when I heard you coming,
I begged him to go, because you know grandmamma would
be very angry, if she knew that I had given speech to a
man, even for a few moments; she thinks men are so
dreadful."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
"I must seek this youth," said the monk, in a musing
tone; "perhaps I may find out what inward temptation
hath driven him away from the fold."</p>

<p>"Oh, do, dear uncle, do!" said Agnes, earnestly. "I
am sure that he has been grievously tempted and misled,
for he seems to have a noble and gentle nature; and he
spoke so feelingly of his mother, who is a saint in heaven;
and he seemed so earnestly to long to return to the bosom
of the Church."</p>

<p>"The Church is a tender mother to all her erring children,"
said the monk.</p>

<p>"And don't you think that our dear Holy Father the
Pope will forgive him?" said Agnes. "Surely, he will
have all the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who would
rejoice in one sheep found more than in all the ninety-and-nine
who went not astray."</p>

<p>The monk could scarcely repress a smile at imagining
Alexander the Sixth in this character of a good shepherd,
as Agnes's enthusiastic imagination painted the head of the
Church; and then he gave an inward sigh, and said, softly,
"Lord, how long?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Agnes, "that this young man is of noble
birth, for his words and his bearing and his tones of voice
are not those of common men; even though he speaks so
humbly and gently, there is yet something princely that
looks out of his eyes, as if he were born to command; and
he wears strange jewels, the like of which I never saw, on
his hands and at the hilt of his dagger,&mdash;yet he seems to
make nothing of them. But yet, I know not why, he spoke
of himself as one utterly desolate and forlorn. Father
Francesco told me that he was captain of a band of robbers
who live in the mountains. One cannot think it is so."</p>

<p>"Little heart," said the monk tenderly, "you can scarcely
know what things befall men in these distracted times,
when faction wages war with faction, and men pillage and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
burn and imprison, first on this side, then on that. Many
a son of a noble house may find himself homeless and landless,
and, chased by the enemy, may have no refuge but
the fastnesses of the mountains. Thank God, our lovely
Italy hath a noble backbone of these same mountains, which
afford shelter to her children in their straits."</p>

<p>"Then you think it possible, dear uncle, that this may
not be a bad man, after all?"</p>

<p>"Let us hope so, child. I will myself seek him out;
and if his mind have been chafed by violence or injustice,
I will strive to bring him back into the good ways of the
Lord. Take heart, my little one,&mdash;all will yet be well.
Come now, little darling, wipe your bright eyes, and look
at these plans I have been making for the shrine we were
talking of, in the gorge. See here, I have drawn a goodly
arch with a pinnacle. Under the arch, you see, shall be
the picture of our Lady with the blessed Babe. The arch
shall be cunningly sculptured with vines of ivy and passion-flower;
and on one side of it shall stand Saint Agnes
with her lamb,&mdash;and on the other, Saint Cecilia, crowned
with roses; and on this pinnacle, above all, Saint Michael,
all in armor, shall stand leaning,&mdash;one hand on his sword,
and holding a shield with the cross upon it."</p>

<p>"Ah, that will be beautiful!" said Agnes.</p>

<p>"You can scarcely tell," pursued the monk, "from this
faint drawing, what the picture of our Lady is to be; but
I shall paint her to the highest of my art, and with many
prayers that I may work worthily. You see, she shall be
standing on a cloud with a background all of burnished
gold, like the streets of the New Jerusalem; and she shall
be clothed in a mantle of purest blue from head to foot, to
represent the unclouded sky of summer; and on her forehead
she shall wear the evening star, which ever shineth
when we say the Ave Maria; and all the borders of her
blue vesture shall be cunningly wrought with fringes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
stars; and the dear Babe shall lean his little cheek to hers
so peacefully, and there shall be a clear shining of love
through her face, and a heavenly restfulness, that it shall
do one's heart good to look at her. Many a blessed hour
shall I have over this picture,&mdash;many a hymn shall I sing
as my work goes on. I must go about to prepare the
panels forthwith; and it were well, if there be that young
man who works in stone, to have him summoned to our
conference."</p>

<p>"I think," said Agnes, "that you will find him in the
town; he dwells next to the cathedral."</p>

<p>"I trust he is a youth of pious life and conversation,"
said the monk. "I must call on him this afternoon; for
he ought to be stirring himself up by hymns and prayers,
and by meditations on the beauty of saints and angels, for
so goodly a work. What higher honor or grace can befall
a creature than to be called upon to make visible to men that
beauty of invisible things which is divine and eternal?
How many holy men have given themselves to this work
in Italy, till, from being overrun with heathen temples,
it is now full of most curious and wonderful churches,
shrines, and cathedrals, every stone of which is a miracle
of beauty! I would, dear daughter, you could see our
great Duomo in Florence, which is a mountain of precious
marbles and many-colored mosaics; and the Campanile that
riseth thereby is like a lily of Paradise,&mdash;so tall, so stately,
with such an infinite grace, and adorned all the way up
with holy emblems and images of saints and angels; nor is
there any part of it, within or without, that is not finished
sacredly with care, as an offering to the most perfect God.
Truly, our fair Florence, though she be little, is worthy, by
her sacred adornments, to be worn as the lily of our Lady's
girdle, even as she hath been dedicated to her."</p>

<p>Agnes seemed pleased with the enthusiastic discourse of
her uncle. The tears gradually dried from her eyes as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
listened to him, and the hope so natural to the young and
untried heart began to reassert itself. God was merciful,
the world beautiful; there was a tender Mother, a reigning
Saviour, protecting angels and guardian saints: surely,
then, there was no need to despair of the recall of any
wanderer; and the softest supplication of the most ignorant
and unworthy would be taken up by so many sympathetic
voices in the invisible world, and borne on in so many
waves of brightness to the heavenly throne, that the most
timid must have hope in prayer.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, the monk went to the town to seek
the young artist, and also to inquire for the stranger for
whom his pastoral offices were in requisition, and Agnes
remained alone in the little solitary garden.</p>

<p>It was one of those rich slumberous afternoons of spring
that seem to bathe earth and heaven with an Elysian softness;
and from her little lonely nook shrouded in dusky
shadows by its orange-trees, Agnes looked down the sombre
gorge to where the open sea lay panting and palpitating in
blue and violet waves, while the little white sails of fishing-boats
drifted hither and thither, now silvered in the
sunshine, now fading away like a dream into the violet
vapor bands that mantled the horizon. The weather would
have been oppressively sultry but for the gentle breeze
which constantly drifted landward with coolness in its
wings. The hum of the old town came to her ear softened
by distance and mingled with the patter of the fountain
and the music of birds singing in the trees overhead.
Agnes tried to busy herself with her spinning; but her
mind constantly wandered away, and stirred and undulated
with a thousand dim and unshaped thoughts and emotions,
of which she vaguely questioned in her own mind. Why
did Father Francesco warn her so solemnly against an
earthly love? Did he not know her vocation? But still
he was wisest and must know best; there must be danger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
if he said so. But then, this knight had spoken so modestly,
so humbly,&mdash;so differently from Giulietta's lovers!&mdash;for
Giulietta had sometimes found a chance to recount
to Agnes some of her triumphs. How could it be that a
knight so brave and gentle, and so piously brought up,
should become an infidel? Ah, uncle Antonio was right,&mdash;he
must have had some foul wrong, some dreadful injury!
When Agnes was a child, in traveling with her
grandmother through one of the highest passes of the
Apennines, she had chanced to discover a wounded eagle,
whom an arrow had pierced, sitting all alone by himself on
a rock, with his feathers ruffled, and a film coming over
his great, clear, bright eye,&mdash;and, ever full of compassion,
she had taken him to nurse, and had traveled for a day
with him in her arms; and the mournful look of his regal
eyes now came into her memory. "Yes," she said to herself,
"he is like my poor eagle! The archers have wounded
him, so that he is glad to find shelter even with a poor
maid like me; but it was easy to see my eagle had been
king among birds, even as this knight is among men. Certainly,
God must love him,&mdash;he is so beautiful and noble!
I hope dear uncle will find him this afternoon; he knows
how to teach him; as for me I can only pray."</p>

<p>Such were the thoughts that Agnes twisted into the
shining white flax, while her eyes wandered dreamily over
the soft hazy landscape. At last, lulled by the shivering
sound of leaves, and the bird-songs, and wearied with the
agitations of the morning, her head lay back against the
end of the sculptured fountain, the spindle slowly dropped
from her hand, and her eyes were closed in sleep, the murmur
of the fountain still sounding in her dreams. In her
dreams she seemed to be wandering far away among the
purple passes of the Apennines, where she had come years
ago when she was a little girl; with her grandmother she
pushed through old olive-groves, weird and twisted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
many a quaint gnarl, and rustling their pale silvery leaves
in noonday twilight. Sometimes she seemed to carry in
her bosom a wounded eagle, and often she sat down to
stroke it and to try to give it food from her hand, and as
often it looked upon her with a proud, patient eye, and
then her grandmother seemed to shake her roughly by the
arm and bid her throw the silly bird away;&mdash;but then
again the dream changed, and she saw a knight lie bleeding
and dying in a lonely hollow,&mdash;is garments torn, his
sword broken, and his face pale and faintly streaked with
blood; and she kneeled by him, trying in vain to stanch
a deadly wound in his side, while he said reproachfully,
"Agnes, dear Agnes, why would you not save me?" and
then she thought he kissed her hand with his cold dying
lips; and she shivered and awoke,&mdash;to find that her hand
was indeed held in that of the cavalier, whose eyes met her
own when first she unclosed them, and the same voice that
spoke in her dream said, "Agnes, dear Agnes!"</p>

<p>For a moment she seemed stupefied and confounded, and
sat passively regarding the knight, who kneeled at her feet
and repeatedly kissed her hand, calling her his saint, his
star, his life, and whatever other fair name poetry lends to
love. All at once, however, her face flushed crimson red,
she drew her hand quickly away, and, rising up, made a
motion to retreat, saying, in a voice of <span class="locked">alarm,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Oh, my Lord, this must not be! I am committing
deadly sin to hear you. Please, please go! please leave
a poor girl!"</p>

<p>"Agnes, what does this mean?" said the cavalier.
"Only two days since, in this place, you promised to love
me; and that promise has brought me from utter despair
to love of life. Nay, since you told me that, I have been
able to pray once more; the whole world seems changed
for me: and now will you take it all away,&mdash;you, who
are all I have on earth?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
"My Lord, I did not know then that I was sinning.
Our dear Mother knows I said only what I thought was
true and right, but I find it was a sin."</p>

<p>"A sin to love, Agnes? Heaven must be full of sin,
then; for there they do nothing else."</p>

<p>"Oh, my Lord, I must not argue with you; I am forbidden
to listen even for a moment. Please go. I will
never forget you, sir,&mdash;never forget to pray for you, and
to love you as they love in heaven; but I am forbidden to
speak with you. I fear I have sinned in hearing and saying
even this much."</p>

<p>"Who forbids you, Agnes? Who has the right to forbid
your good, kind heart to love, where love is so deeply
needed and so gratefully received?"</p>

<p>"My holy father, whom I am bound to obey as my
soul's director," said Agnes. "He has forbidden me so
much as to listen to a word, and yet I have listened to
many. How could I help it?"</p>

<p>"Ever these priests!" said the cavalier, his brow darkening
with an impatient frown; "wolves in sheep's clothing!"</p>

<p>"Alas!" said Agnes, sorrowfully, "why will <span class="locked">you"&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Why will I what?" he said, facing suddenly toward
her and looking down with a fierce, scornful determination.</p>

<p>"Why will you be at war with the Holy Church? Why
will you peril your eternal salvation?"</p>

<p>"Is there a Holy Church? Where is it? Would there
were one! I am blind and cannot see it. Little Agnes,
you promised to lead me; but you drop my hand in the
darkness. Who will guide me, if you will not?"</p>

<p>"My Lord, I am most unfit to be your guide. I am a
poor girl, without any learning; but there is my uncle I
spoke to you of. Oh, my Lord, if you only would go to
him, he is wise and gentle both. I must go in now, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Lord,&mdash;indeed, I must. I must not sin further. I must
do a heavy penance for having listened and spoken to you,
after the holy father had forbidden me."</p>

<p>"No, Agnes, you shall not go in," said the cavalier,
suddenly stepping before her and placing himself across the
doorway; "you shall see me, and hear me too. I take
the sin on myself; you cannot help it. How will you
avoid me? Will you fly now down the path of the gorge?
I will follow you,&mdash;I am desperate. I had but one comfort
on earth, but one hope of heaven, and that through
you; and you, cruel, are so ready to give me up at the
first word of your priest!"</p>

<p>"God knows if I do it willingly," said Agnes; "but I
know it is best; for I feel I should love you too well, if
I saw more of you. My Lord, you are strong and can
compel me, but I beg you to leave me."</p>

<p>"Dear Agnes, could you really feel it possible that you
might love me too well?" said the cavalier, his whole manner
changing. "Ah! could I carry you far away to my
home in the mountains, far up in the beautiful blue mountains,
where the air is so clear, and the weary, wrangling
world lies so far below that one forgets it entirely, you
should be my wife, my queen, my empress. You should
lead me where you would, your word should be my law.
I will go with you wherever you will,&mdash;to confession, to
sacrament, to prayers, never so often; never will I rebel
against your word; if you decree, I will bend my neck to
king or priest; I will reconcile me with anybody or anything
only for your sweet sake; you shall lead me all my
life; and when we die, I ask only that you may lead me
to our Mother's throne in heaven, and pray her to tolerate
me for your sake. Come, now, dear, is not even one unworthy
soul worth saving?"</p>

<p>"My Lord, you have taught me how wise my holy father
was in forbidding me to listen to you. He knew better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
than I how weak was my heart, and how I might be drawn
on from step to step till&mdash;My Lord, I must be no man's
wife. I follow the blessed Saint Agnes! May God give
me grace to keep my vows without wavering!&mdash;for then I
shall gain power to intercede for you and bring down blessings
on your soul. Oh, never, never speak to me so again,
my Lord!&mdash;you will make me very, <i>very</i> unhappy. If
there is any truth in your words, my Lord, if you really
love me, you will go, and you will never try to speak to
me again."</p>

<p>"Never, Agnes? never? Think what you are saying!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I do think! I know it must be best," said Agnes,
much agitated; "for, if I should see you often and hear
your voice, I should lose all my strength. I could never
resist, and I should lose heaven for you and me too.
Leave me, and I will never, never forget to pray for you;
and go quickly too, for it is time for my grandmother to
come home, and she would be so angry,&mdash;she would never
believe I had not been doing wrong, and perhaps she would
make me marry somebody that I do not wish to. She has
threatened that many times; but I beg her to leave me free
to go to my sweet home in the convent and my dear Mother
Theresa."</p>

<p>"They shall never marry you against your will, little
Agnes, I pledge you my knightly word. I will protect
you from that. Promise me, dear, that, if ever you be
man's wife, you will be mine. Only promise me that, and
I will go."</p>

<p>"Will you?" said Agnes, in an ecstasy of fear and
apprehension, in which there mingled some strange troubled
gleams of happiness. "Well, then, I will. Ah! I
hope it is no sin!"</p>

<p>"Believe me, dearest, it is not," said the knight. "Say
it again,&mdash;say, that I may hear it,&mdash;say, 'If ever I am
man's wife, I will be thine,'&mdash;say it, and I will go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
"Well, then, my Lord, if ever I am man's wife, I will
be thine," said Agnes. "But I will be no man's wife.
My heart and hand are promised elsewhere. Come, now,
my Lord, your word must be kept."</p>

<p>"Let me put this ring on your finger, lest you forget,"
said the cavalier. "It was my mother's ring, and never
during her lifetime heard anything but prayers and hymns.
It is saintly, and worthy of thee."</p>

<p>"No, my Lord, I may not. Grandmother would inquire
about it. I cannot keep it; but fear not my forgetting;
I shall never forget you."</p>

<p>"Will you ever want to see me, Agnes?"</p>

<p>"I hope not, since it is not best. But you do not go."</p>

<p>"Well, then, farewell, my little wife! farewell, till I
claim thee!" said the cavalier, as he kissed her hand, and
vaulted over the wall.</p>

<p>"How strange that I cannot make him understand!"
said Agnes, when he was gone. "I must have sinned, I
must have done wrong; but I have been trying all the
while to do right. Why would he stay so, and look at me
so with those deep eyes? I was very hard with him,&mdash;very!
I trembled for him, I was so severe; and yet it
has not discouraged him enough. How strange that he
would call me so, after all, when I explained to him I
never could marry! Must I tell all this to Father Francesco?
How dreadful! How he looked at me before!
How he trembled and turned away from me! What will
he think now? Ah, me! why must I tell <i>him</i>? If I
could only confess to my mother Theresa, that would be
easier. We have a mother in heaven to hear us; why
should we not have a mother on earth? Father Francesco
frightens me so! His eyes burn me! They seem to burn
into my soul, and he seems angry with me sometimes, and
sometimes looks at me so strangely! Dear, blessed Mother,"
she said, kneeing at the shrine, "help thy little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
child! I do not want to do wrong: I want to do right.
Oh that I could come and live with thee!"</p>

<p>Poor Agnes! a new experience had opened in her heretofore
tranquil life, and her day was one of conflict. Do
what she would, the words that had been spoken to her in
the morning would return to her mind, and sometimes she
awoke with a shock of guilty surprise at finding she had
been dreaming over what the cavalier said to her of living
with him alone, in some clear, high, purple solitude of
those beautiful mountains which she remembered as an enchanted
dream of her childhood. Would he really always
love her, then, always go with her to prayers and mass and
sacrament, and be reconciled to the Church, and should
she indeed have the joy of feeling that this noble soul was
led back to heavenly peace through her? Was not this
better than a barren life of hymns and prayers in a cold
convent? Then the very voice that said these words, that
voice of veiled strength and manly daring, that spoke with
such a gentle pleading, and yet such an undertone of authority,
as if he had a right to claim her for himself,&mdash;she
seemed to feel the tones of that voice in every nerve;&mdash;and
then the strange thrilling pleasure of thinking that
he loved her so. Why should he, this strange, beautiful
knight? Doubtless he had seen splendid high-born ladies,&mdash;he
had seen even queens and princesses,&mdash;and what
could he find to like in her, a poor little peasant? Nobody
ever thought so much of her before, and he was so
unhappy without her;&mdash;it was strange he should be; but
he said so, and it must be true. After all, Father Francesco
might be mistaken about his being wicked. On the
whole, she felt sure he was mistaken, at least in part.
Uncle Antonio did not seem to be so much shocked at
what she told him; he knew the temptations of men better,
perhaps, because he did not stay shut up in one convent,
but traveled all about, preaching and teaching. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
only he could see him, and talk with him, and make him
a good Christian,&mdash;why, then, there would be no further
need of her; and Agnes was surprised to find what a dreadful,
dreary blank appeared before her when she thought of
this. Why should she wish him to remember her, since
she never could be his?&mdash;and yet nothing seemed so dreadful
as that he should forget her. So the poor little innocent
fly beat and fluttered in the mazes of that enchanted
web, where thousands of her frail sex have beat and fluttered
before.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MONK AND THE CAVALIER</span></h2>

<p>Father Antonio had been down through the streets
of the old town of Sorrento, searching for the young stonecutter,
and finding him had spent some time in enlightening
him as to the details of the work he wished him to execute.</p>

<p>He found him not so easily kindled into devotional fervors
as he had fondly imagined, nor could all his most devout
exhortations produce one quarter of the effect upon
him that resulted from the discovery that it was the fair
Agnes who originated the design and was interested in its
execution. Then did the large black eyes of the youth
kindle into something of sympathetic fervor, and he willingly
promised to do his very best at the carving.</p>

<p>"I used to know the fair Agnes well, years ago," he
said, "but of late she will not even look at me; yet I
worship her none the less. Who can help it that sees her?
I don't think she is so hard-hearted as she seems; but her
grandmother and the priests won't so much as allow her to
lift up her eyes when one of us young fellows goes by.
Twice these five years past have I seen her eyes, and then
it was when I contrived to get near the holy water when
there was a press round it of a saint's day, and I reached
some to her on my finger, and then she smiled upon me
and thanked me. Those two smiles are all I have had to
live on for all this time. Perhaps, if I work very well,
she will give me another, and perhaps she will say, 'Thank
you, my good Pietro!' as she used to, when I brought her
birds' eggs or helped her across the ravine, years ago."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
"Well, my brave boy, do your best," said the monk,
"and let the shrine be of the fairest white marble. I will
be answerable for the expense; I will beg it of those who
have substance."</p>

<p>"So please you, holy father," said Pietro, "I know of
a spot, a little below here on the coast, where was a heathen
temple in the old days; and one can dig therefrom long
pieces of fair white marble, all covered with heathen images.
I know not whether your Reverence would think
them fit for Christian purposes."</p>

<p>"So much the better, boy! so much the better!" said
the monk, heartily. "Only let the marble be fine and
white, and it is as good as converting a heathen any time
to baptize it to Christian uses. A few strokes of the chisel
will soon demolish their naked nymphs and other such rubbish,
and we can carve holy virgins, robed from head to
foot in all modesty, as becometh saints."</p>

<p>"I will get my boat and go down this very afternoon,"
said Pietro; "and, sir, I hope I am not making too bold
in asking you, when you see the fair Agnes, to present
unto her this lily, in memorial of her old playfellow."</p>

<p>"That I will, my boy! And now I think of it, she
spoke kindly of you as one that had been a companion in
her childhood, but said her grandmother would not allow
her to speak to you now."</p>

<p>"Ah, that is it!" said Pietro. "Old Elsie is a fierce
old kite, with strong beak and long claws, and will not let
the poor girl have any good of her youth. Some say she
means to marry her to some rich old man, and some say
she will shut her up in a convent, which I should say was
a sore hurt and loss to the world. There are a plenty of
women, whom nobody wants to look at, for that sort of
work; and a beautiful face is a kind of psalm which makes
one want to be good."</p>

<p>"Well, well, my boy, work well and faithfully for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
saints on this shrine, and I dare promise you many a smile
from this fair maiden; for her heart is set upon the glory
of God and his saints, and she will smile on any one who
helps on the good work. I shall look in on you daily for
a time, till I see the work well started."</p>

<p>So saying, the old monk took his leave. Just as he was
passing out of the house, some one brushed rapidly by him,
going down the street. As he passed, the quick eye of the
monk recognized the cavalier whom he had seen in the garden
but a few evenings before. It was not a face and form
easily forgotten, and the monk followed him at a little distance
behind, resolving, if he saw him turn in anywhere,
to follow and crave an audience of him.</p>

<p>Accordingly, as he saw the cavalier entering under the
low arch that led to his hotel, he stepped up and addressed
him with a gesture of benediction.</p>

<p>"God bless you, my son!"</p>

<p>"What would you with me, father?" said the cavalier,
with a hasty and somewhat suspicious glance.</p>

<p>"I would that you would give me an audience of a few
moments on some matters of importance," said the monk,
mildly.</p>

<p>The tones of his voice seemed to have excited some
vague remembrance in the mind of the cavalier; for he
eyed him narrowly, and seemed trying to recollect where
he had seen him before. Suddenly a light appeared to
flash upon his mind; for his whole manner became at once
more cordial.</p>

<p>"My good father," he said, "my poor lodging and leisure
are at your service for any communication you may
see fit to make."</p>

<p>So saying, he led the way up the damp, ill-smelling
stone staircase, and opened the door of the deserted room
where we have seen him once before. Closing the door,
and seating himself at the one rickety table which the room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
afforded, he motioned to the monk to be seated also; then
taking off his plumed hat, he threw it negligently on the
table beside him, and passing his white, finely formed hand
through the black curls of his hair, he tossed them carelessly
from his forehead, and, leaning his chin in the hollow
of his hand, fixed his glittering eyes on the monk in
a manner that seemed to demand his errand.</p>

<p>"My Lord," said the monk, in those gentle, conciliating
tones which were natural to him, "I would ask a little help
of you in regard of a Christian undertaking which I have
here in hand. The dear Lord hath put it into the heart
of a pious young maid of this vicinity to erect a shrine to
the honor of our Lady and her dear Son in this gorge of
Sorrento, hard by. It is a gloomy place in the night, and
hath been said to be haunted by evil spirits; and my fair
niece, who is full of all holy thoughts, desired me to draw
the plan for this shrine, and, so far as my poor skill may go,
I have done so. See, here, my Lord, are the drawings."</p>

<p>The monk laid them down on the table, his pale cheek
flushing with a faint glow of artistic enthusiasm and pride,
as he explained to the young man the plan and drawings.</p>

<p>The cavalier listened courteously, but without much
apparent interest, till the monk drew from his portfolio a
paper and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"This, my Lord, is my poor and feeble conception of
the most sacred form of our Lady, which I am to paint for
the centre of the shrine."</p>

<p>He laid down the paper, and the cavalier, with a sudden
exclamation, snatched it up, looking at it eagerly.</p>

<p>"It is she!" he said; "it is her very self!&mdash;the divine
Agnes,&mdash;the lily flower,&mdash;the sweet star,&mdash;the only one
among women!"</p>

<p>"I see you have recognized the likeness," said the monk,
blushing. "I know it hath been thought a practice of
doubtful edification to represent holy things under the image<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
of aught earthly; but when any mortal seems especially
gifted with a heavenly spirit outshining in the face, it may
be that our Lady chooses that person to reveal herself in."</p>

<p>The cavalier was gazing so intently on the picture that
he scarcely heard the apology of the monk; he held it up,
and seemed to study it with a long admiring gaze.</p>

<p>"You have great skill with your pencil, my father," he
said; "one would not look for such things from under a
monk's hood."</p>

<p>"I belong to the San Marco in Florence, of which you
may have heard," said Father Antonio, "and am an unworthy
disciple of the traditions of the blessed Angelico,
whose visions of heavenly things are ever before us; and
no less am I a disciple of the renowned Savonarola, of
whose fame all Italy hath heard before now."</p>

<p>"Savonarola?" said the other, with eagerness,&mdash;"he
that makes these vile miscreants that call themselves Pope
and cardinals tremble? All Italy, all Christendom, is
groaning and stretching out the hand to him to free them
from these abominations. My father, tell me of Savonarola:
how goes he, and what success hath he?"</p>

<p>"My son, it is now many months since I left Florence;
since which time I have been sojourning in by-places, repairing
shrines and teaching the poor of the Lord's flock,
who are scattered and neglected by the idle shepherds, who
think only to eat the flesh and warm themselves with the
fleece of the sheep for whom the Good Shepherd gave his
life. My duties have been humble and quiet; for it is
not given to me to wield the sword of rebuke and controversy,
like my great master."</p>

<p>"And you have not heard, then," said the cavalier,
eagerly, "that they have excommunicated him?"</p>

<p>"I knew that was threatened," said the monk, "but I
did not think it possible that it could befall a man of such
shining holiness of life, so signally and openly owned of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
God that the very gifts of the first Apostles seem revived
in him."</p>

<p>"Does not Satan always hate the Lord?" said the cavalier.
"Alexander and his councils are possessed of the
Devil, if ever men were,&mdash;and are sealed as his children
by every abominable wickedness. The Devil sits in Christ's
seat, and hath stolen his signet-ring, to seal decrees against
the Lord's own followers. What are Christian men to do
in such case?"</p>

<p>The monk sighed and looked troubled.</p>

<p>"It is hard to say," he answered. "So much I know,&mdash;that
before I left Florence our master wrote to the King
of France touching the dreadful state of things at Rome,
and tried to stir him up to call a general council of the
Church. I much fear me this letter may have fallen into
the hands of the Pope."</p>

<p>"I tell you, father," said the young man, starting up
and laying his hand on his sword, "we must fight! It is
the sword that must decide this matter! Was not the
Holy Sepulchre saved from the Infidels by the sword?&mdash;and
once more the sword must save the Holy City from
worse infidels than the Turks. If such doings as these are
allowed in the Holy City, another generation there will be
no Christians left on earth. Alexander and Cæsar Borgia
and the Lady Lucrezia are enough to drive religion from
the world. They make us long to go back to the traditions
of our Roman fathers,&mdash;who were men of cleanly
and honorable lives and of heroic deeds, scorning bribery
and deceit. They honored God by noble lives, little as
they knew of Him. But these men are a shame to the
mothers that bore them."</p>

<p>"You speak too truly, my son," said the monk. "Alas!
the creation groaneth and travaileth in pain with these
things. Many a time and oft have I seen our master groaning
and wrestling with God on this account. For it is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
small purpose that we have gone through Italy preaching
and stirring up the people to more holy lives, when from
the very hill of Zion, the height of the sanctuary, come
down these streams of pollution. It seems as if the time
had come that the world could bear it no longer."</p>

<p>"Well, if it come to the trial of the sword, as come it
must," said the cavalier, "say to your master that Agostino
Sarelli has a band of one hundred tried men and an impregnable
fastness in the mountains, where he may take
refuge, and where they will gladly hear the Word of God
from pure lips. They call us robbers,&mdash;us who have gone
out from the assembly of robbers, that we might lead honest
and cleanly lives. There is not one among us that hath
not lost houses, lands, brothers, parents, children, or
friends through their treacherous cruelty. There be those
whose wives and sisters have been forced into the Borgia
harem; there be those whose children have been tortured
before their eyes,&mdash;those who have seen the fairest and
dearest slaughtered by these hell-hounds, who yet sit in
the seat of the Lord and give decrees in the name of Christ.
Is there a God? If there be, why is He silent?"</p>

<p>"Yea, my son, there is a God," said the monk; "but
His ways are not as ours. A thousand years in His sight
are but as yesterday, as a watch in the night. He shall
come, and shall not keep silence."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you do not know, father," said the young
man, "that I, too, am excommunicated. I am excommunicated,
because, Cæsar Borgia having killed my oldest
brother, and dishonored and slain my sister, and seized on
all our possessions, and the Pope having protected and confirmed
him therein, I declare the Pope to be not of God,
but of the Devil. I will not submit to him, nor be ruled
by him; and I and my fellows will make good our mountains
against him and his crew with such right arms as the
good Lord hath given us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
"The Lord be with you, my son!" said the monk;
"and the Lord bring His Church out of these deep waters!
Surely, it is a lovely and beautiful Church, made dear and
precious by innumerable saints and martyrs who have given
their sweet lives up willingly for it; and it is full of records
of righteousness, of prayers and alms and works of
mercy that have made even the very dust of our Italy precious
and holy. Why hast Thou abandoned this vine of
Thy planting, O Lord? The boar out of the wood doth
waste it; the wild beast of the field doth devour it. Return,
we beseech Thee, and visit this vine of Thy planting!"</p>

<p>The monk clasped his hands and looked upward pleadingly,
the tears running down his wasted cheeks. Ah,
many such strivings and prayers in those days went up
from silent hearts in obscure solitudes, that wrestled and
groaned under that mighty burden which Luther at last
received strength to heave from the heart of the Church.</p>

<p>"Then, father, you do admit that one may be banned
by the Pope, and may utterly refuse and disown him, and
yet be a Christian?"</p>

<p>"How can I otherwise?" said the monk. "Do I not see
the greatest saint this age or any age has ever seen under
the excommunication of the greatest sinner? Only, my son,
let me warn you. Become not irreverent to the true Church,
because of a false usurper. Reverence the sacraments, the
hymns, the prayers all the more for this sad condition in
which you stand. What teacher is more faithful in these
respects than my master? Who hath more zeal for our
blessed Lord Jesus, and a more living faith in Him? Who
hath a more filial love and tenderness towards our blessed
Mother? Who hath more reverent communion with all the
saints than he? Truly, he sometimes seems to me to walk
encompassed by all the armies of heaven,&mdash;such a power
goes forth in his words, and such a holiness in his life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
"Ah," said Agostino, "would I had such a confessor!
The sacraments might once more have power for me, and
I might cleanse my soul from unbelief."</p>

<p>"Dear son," said the monk, "accept a most unworthy,
but sincere follower of this holy prophet, who yearns for
thy salvation. Let me have the happiness of granting to
thee the sacraments of the Church, which, doubtless, are
thine by right as one of the flock of the Lord Jesus.
Come to me some day this week in confession, and thereafter
thou shalt receive the Lord within thee, and be once
more united to Him."</p>

<p>"My good father," said the young man, grasping his
hand, and much affected, "I will come. Your words have
done me good; but I must think more of them. I will
come soon; but these things cannot be done without pondering;
it will take some time to bring my heart into charity
with all men."</p>

<p>The monk rose up to depart, and began to gather up his
drawings.</p>

<p>"For this matter, father," said the cavalier, throwing
several gold pieces upon the table, "take these, and as
many more as you need ask for your good work. I would
willingly pay any sum," he added, while a faint blush rose
to his cheek, "if you would give me a copy of this. Gold
would be nothing in comparison with it."</p>

<p>"My son," said the monk, smiling, "would it be to thee
an image of an earthly or a heavenly love?"</p>

<p>"Of both, father," said the young man. "For that
dear face has been more to me than prayer or hymn; it
has been even as a sacrament to me, and through it I know
not what of holy and heavenly influences have come to
me."</p>

<p>"Said I not well," said the monk, exulting, "that there
were those on whom our Mother shed such grace that their
very beauty led heavenward? Such are they whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
artist looks for, when he would adorn a shrine where the
faithful shall worship. Well, my son, I must use my
poor art for you; and as for gold, we of our convent take
it not except for the adorning of holy things, such as this
shrine."</p>

<p>"How soon shall it be done?" said the young man,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Patience, patience, my Lord! Rome was not built in
a day, and our art must work by slow touches; but I will
do my best. But wherefore, my Lord, cherish this image?"</p>

<p>"Father, are you of near kin to this maid?"</p>

<p>"I am her grandmother's only brother."</p>

<p>"Then I say to you, as the nearest of her male kin, that
I seek this maid in pure and honorable marriage; and she
hath given me her promise, that, if ever she be wife of
mortal man, she will be mine."</p>

<p>"But she looks not to be wife of any man," said the
monk; "so, at least, I have heard her say; though her
grandmother would fain marry her to a husband of her
choosing. 'T is a willful woman, is my sister Elsie, and
a worldly,&mdash;not easy to persuade, and impossible to
drive."</p>

<p>"And she hath chosen for this fair angel some base
peasant churl who will have no sense of her exceeding
loveliness? By the saints, if it come to this, I will carry
her away with the strong arm!"</p>

<p>"That is not to be apprehended just at present. Sister
Elsie is dotingly fond of the girl, which hath slept in her
bosom since infancy."</p>

<p>"And why should I not demand her in marriage of your
sister?" said the young man.</p>

<p>"My Lord, you are an excommunicated man, and she
would have horror of you. It is impossible; it would not
be to edification to make the common people judges in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
matters. It is safest to let their faith rest undisturbed,
and that they be not taught to despise ecclesiastical censures.
This could not be explained to Elsie; she would
drive you from her doors with her distaff, and you would
scarce wish to put your sword against it. Besides, my
Lord, if you were not excommunicated, you are of noble
blood, and this alone would be a fatal objection with my
sister, who hath sworn on the holy cross that Agnes shall
never love one of your race."</p>

<p>"What is the cause of this hatred?"</p>

<p>"Some foul wrong which a noble did her mother," said
the monk; "for Agnes is of gentle blood on her father's
side."</p>

<p>"I might have known it," said the cavalier to himself;
"her words and ways are unlike anything in her class.
Father," he added, touching his sword, "we soldiers are
fond of cutting all Gordian knots, whether of love or religion,
with this. The sword, father, is the best theologian,
the best casuist. The sword rights wrongs and punishes
evil doers, and some day the sword may cut the way out
of this embarrass also."</p>

<p>"Gently, my son! gently!" said the monk; "nothing is
lost by patience. See how long it takes the good Lord to
make a fair flower out of a little seed; and He does all
quietly, without bluster. Wait on Him a little in peacefulness
and prayer, and see what He will do for thee."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right, my father," said the cavalier,
cordially. "Your counsels have done me good, and I shall
seek them further. But do not let them terrify my poor
Agnes with dreadful stories of the excommunication that
hath befallen me. The dear saint is breaking her good
little heart for my sins, and her confessor evidently hath
forbidden her to speak to me or look at me. If her heart
were left to itself, it would fly to me like a little tame
bird, and I would cherish it forever; but now she sees sin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
in every innocent, womanly thought,&mdash;poor little dear
child-angel that she is!"</p>

<p>"Her confessor is a Franciscan," said the monk, who,
good as he was, could not escape entirely from the ruling
prejudice of his order, "and from what I know of him,
I should think might be unskillful in what pertaineth to
the nursing of so delicate a lamb. It is not every one to
whom is given the gift of rightly directing souls."</p>

<p>"I'd like to carry her off from him!" said the cavalier,
between his teeth. "I will, too, if he is not careful!"
Then he added aloud, "Father, Agnes is mine,&mdash;mine by
the right of the truest worship and devotion that man
could ever pay to woman,&mdash;mine because she loves me.
For I know she loves me; I know it far better than she
knows it herself, the dear, innocent child! and I will not
have her torn from me to waste her life in a lonely, barren
convent, or to be the wife of a stolid peasant. I am a man
of my word, and I will vindicate my right to her in the
face of God and man."</p>

<p>"Well, well, my son, as I said before, patience,&mdash;one
thing at a time. Let us say our prayers and sleep to-night,
to begin with, and to-morrow will bring us fresh
counsel."</p>

<p>"Well, my father, you will be for me in this matter?"
said the young man.</p>

<p>"My son, I wish you all happiness; and if this be for
your best good and that of my dear niece, I wish it. But,
as I said, there must be time and patience. The way must
be made clear. I will see how the case stands; and you
may be sure, when I can in good conscience, I will befriend
you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my father, thank you!" said the young
man, bending his knee to receive the monk's parting benediction.</p>

<p>"It seems to me not best," said the monk, turning once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
more, as he was leaving the threshold, "that you should
come to me at present where I am,&mdash;it would only raise a
storm that I could not allay; and so great would be the
power of the forces they might bring to bear on the child,
that her little heart might break and the saints claim her
too soon."</p>

<p>"Well, then, father, come hither to me to-morrow at
this same hour, if I be not too unworthy of your pastoral
care."</p>

<p>"I shall be too happy, my son," said the monk. "So
be it."</p>

<p>And he turned from the door just as the bell of the
cathedral struck the Ave Maria, and all in the street bowed
in the evening act of worship.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MONK'S STRUGGLE</span></h2>

<p>The golden sunshine of the spring morning was deadened
to a sombre tone in the shadowy courts of the Capuchin
convent. The reddish brown of the walls was flecked
with gold and orange spots of lichen; and here and there,
in crevices, tufts of grass, or even a little bunch of gold-blooming
flowers, looked hardily forth into the shadowy
air. A covered walk, with stone arches, inclosed a square
filled with dusky shrubbery. There were tall, funereal
cypresses, whose immense height and scraggy profusion of
decaying branches showed their extreme old age. There
were gaunt, gnarled olives, with trunks twisted in immense
serpent folds, and boughs wreathed and knotted into wild,
unnatural contractions, as if their growth had been a series
of spasmodic convulsions, instead of a calm and gentle
development of Nature. There were overgrown clumps of
aloes, with the bare skeletons of former flower-stalks standing
erect among their dusky horns or lying rotting on the
ground beside them. The place had evidently been intended
for the culture of shrubbery and flowers, but the
growth of the trees had long since so intercepted the sunlight
and fresh air that not even grass could find root beneath
their branches. The ground was covered with a
damp green mould, strewn here and there with dead
boughs, or patched with tufts of fern and lycopodium,
throwing out their green hairy roots into the moist soil.
A few half-dead roses and jasmines, remnants of former
days of flowers, still maintained a struggling existence, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
looked wan and discouraged in the effort, and seemed to
stretch and pine vaguely for a freer air. In fact, the whole
garden might be looked upon as a sort of symbol of the life
by which it was surrounded,&mdash;a life stagnant, unnatural,
and unhealthy, cut off from all those thousand stimulants
to wholesome development which are afforded by the open
plain of human existence, where strong natures grow distorted
in unnatural efforts, though weaker ones find in its
lowly shadows a congenial refuge.</p>

<p>We have given the brighter side of conventual life in
the days we are describing: we have shown it as often a
needed shelter of woman's helplessness during ages of political
uncertainty and revolution; we have shown it as the
congenial retreat where the artist, the poet, the student,
and the man devoted to ideas found leisure undisturbed
to develop themselves under the consecrating protection of
religion. The picture would be unjust to truth, did we
not recognize, what, from our knowledge of human nature,
we must expect, a conventual life of far less elevated and
refined order. We should expect that institutions which
guaranteed to each individual a livelihood, without the
necessity of physical labor or the responsibility of supporting
a family, might in time come to be incumbered with
many votaries in whom indolence and improvidence were
the only impelling motives. In all ages of the world the
unspiritual are the majority,&mdash;the spiritual the exceptions.
It was to the multitude that Jesus said, "Ye seek me not
because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat and
were filled,"&mdash;and the multitude has been much of the
same mind from that day to this.</p>

<p>The convent of which we speak had been for some years
under the lenient rule of the jolly Brother Girolamo,&mdash;an
easy, wide-spread, loosely organized body, whose views of
the purpose of human existence were decidedly Anacreontic.
Fasts he abominated,&mdash;night-prayers he found unfavorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
to his constitution; but he was a judge of olives and good
wine, and often threw out valuable hints in his pastoral
visits on the cooking of macaroni, for which he had himself
elaborated a savory recipe; and the cellar and larder
of the convent, during his pastorate, presented so many
urgent solicitations to conventual repose, as to threaten an
inconvenient increase in the number of others. The monks
in his time lounged in all the sunny places of the convent
like so many loose sacks of meal, enjoying to the full the
<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">dolce far niente</i> which seems to be the universal rule of
Southern climates. They ate and drank and slept and
snored; they made pastoral visits through the surrounding
community which were far from edifying; they gambled,
and tippled, and sang most unspiritual songs; and keeping
all the while their own private pass-key to Paradise tucked
under their girdles, were about as jolly a set of sailors to
Eternity as the world had to show. In fact, the climate
of Southern Italy and its gorgeous scenery are more favorable
to voluptuous ecstasy than to the severe and grave
warfare of the true Christian soldier. The sunny plains
of Capua demoralized the soldiers of Hannibal, and it was
not without a reason that ancient poets made those lovely
regions the abode of Sirens whose song maddened by its
sweetness, and of a Circe who made men drunk with her
sensual fascinations, till they became sunk to the form of
brutes. Here, if anywhere, is the lotos-eater's paradise,&mdash;the
purple skies, the enchanted shores, the soothing
gales, the dreamy mists, which all conspire to melt the
energy of the will, and to make existence either a half doze
of dreamy apathy or an awaking of mad delirium.</p>

<p>It was not from dreamy, voluptuous Southern Italy that
the religious progress of the Italian race received any vigorous
impulses. These came from more northern and more
mountainous regions, from the severe, clear heights of
Florence, Perugia, and Assisi, where the intellectual and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
the moral both had somewhat of the old Etruscan earnestness
and gloom.</p>

<p>One may easily imagine the stupid alarm and helpless
confusion of these easy-going monks, when their new Superior
came down among them hissing with a white heat from
the very hottest furnace fires of a new religious experience,
burning and quivering with the terrors of the world to
come,&mdash;pale, thin, eager, tremulous, and yet with all the
martial vigor of the former warrior, and all the habits of
command of a former princely station. His reforms gave
no quarter to right or left; sleepy monks were dragged out
to midnight prayers, and their devotions enlivened with
vivid pictures of hell-fire and ingenuities of eternal torment
enough to stir the blood of the most torpid. There was to
be no more gormandizing, no more wine-bibbing; the choice
old wines were placed under lock and key for the use of
the sick and poor in the vicinity; and every fast of the
Church, and every obsolete rule of the order, were revived
with unsparing rigor. It is true, they hated their new
Superior with all the energy which laziness and good-living
had left them, but they every soul of them shook in their
sandals before him; for there is a true and established order
of mastery among human beings, and when a man of
enkindled energy and intense will comes among a flock of
irresolute commonplace individuals, he subjects them to
himself by a sort of moral paralysis similar to what a great,
vigorous gymnotus distributes among a fry of inferior fishes.
The bolder ones, who made motions of rebellion, were so
energetically swooped upon, and consigned to the discipline
of dungeon and bread-and-water, that less courageous natures
made a merit of siding with the more powerful party,
mentally resolving to carry by fraud the points which they
despaired of accomplishing by force.</p>

<p>On the morning we speak of, two monks might have
been seen lounging on a stone bench by one of the arches,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
looking listlessly into the sombre garden-path we have
described. The first of these, Father Anselmo, was a corpulent
fellow, with an easy swing of gait, heavy animal
features, and an eye of shrewd and stealthy cunning: the
whole air of the man expressed the cautious, careful voluptuary.
The other, Father Johannes, was thin, wiry, and
elastic, with hands like birds' claws, and an eye that reminded
one of the crafty cunning of a serpent. His smile
was a curious blending of shrewdness and malignity. He
regarded his companion from time to time obliquely from
the corners of his eyes, to see what impression his words
were making, and had a habit of jerking himself up in the
middle of a sentence and looking warily round to see if
any one were listening, which indicated habitual distrust.</p>

<p>"Our holy Superior is out a good while this morning,"
he said, at length.</p>

<p>The observation was made in the smoothest and most
silken tones, but they carried with them such a singular
suggestion of doubt and inquiry that they seemed like an
accusation.</p>

<p>"Ah?" replied the other, perceiving evidently some
intended undertone of suspicion lurking in the woods, but
apparently resolved not to commit himself to his companion.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the first; "the zeal of the house of the
Lord consumes him, the blessed man!"</p>

<p>"Blessed man!" echoed the second, rolling up his eyes,
and giving a deep sigh, which shook his portly proportions
so that they quivered like jelly.</p>

<p>"If he goes on in this way much longer," continued
Father Johannes, "there will soon be very little mortal left
of him; the saints will claim him."</p>

<p>Father Anselmo gave something resembling a pious
groan, but darted meanwhile a shrewd observant glance at
the speaker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
"What would become of the convent, were he gone?"
said Father Johannes. "All these blessed reforms which
he has brought about would fall back; for our nature is
fearfully corrupt, and ever tends to wallow in the mire of
sin and pollution. What changes hath he wrought in us
all! To be sure, the means were sometimes severe. I
remember, brother, when he had you under ground for
more than ten days. My heart was pained for you; but I
suppose you know that it was necessary, in order to bring
you to that eminent state of sanctity where you now stand."</p>

<p>The heavy, sensual features of Father Anselmo flushed
up with some emotion, whether of anger or of fear it was
hard to tell; but he gave one hasty glance at his companion,
which, if a glance could kill, would have struck him
dead, and then there fell over his countenance, like a veil,
an expression of sanctimonious humility as he <span class="locked">replied,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Thank you for your sympathy, dearest brother. I remember,
too, how I felt for you that week when you were
fed only on bread and water, and had to take it on your
knees off the floor, while the rest of us sat at table. How
blessed it must be to have one's pride brought down in
that way! When our dear, blessed Superior first came,
brother, you were as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke,
but now what a blessed change! It must give you so much
peace! How you must love him!"</p>

<p>"I think we love him about equally," said Father Johannes,
his dark, thin features expressing the concentration
of malignity. "His labors have been blessed among us.
Not often does a faithful shepherd meet so loving a flock.
I have been told that the great Peter Abelard found far
less gratitude. They tried to poison him in the most holy
wine."</p>

<p>"How absurd!" interrupted Father Anselmo, hastily;
"as if the blood of the Lord, as if our Lord himself could
be made poison!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
"Brother, it is a fact," insisted the former, in tones
silvery with humility and sweetness.</p>

<p>"A fact that the most holy blood can be poisoned?"
replied the other, with horror evidently genuine.</p>

<p>"I grieve to say, brother," said Father Johannes, "that
in my profane and worldly days I tried that experiment on
a dog, and the poor brute died in five minutes. Ah, brother,"
he added, observing that his obese companion was
now thoroughly roused, "you see before you the chief of
sinners. Judas was nothing to me; and yet, such are the
triumphs of grace, I am an unworthy member of this most
blessed and pious brotherhood; but I do penance daily in
sackcloth and ashes for my offense."</p>

<p>"But, Brother Johannes, was it really so? did it really
happen?" inquired Father Anselmo, looking puzzled.
"Where, then, is our faith?"</p>

<p>"Doth our faith rest on human reason, or on the evidence
of our senses, Brother Anselmo? I bless God that
I have arrived at that state where I can adoringly say, 'I
believe, because it is impossible.' Yea, brother, I know
it to be a fact that the ungodly have sometimes destroyed
holy men, like our Superior, who could not be induced to
taste wine for any worldly purpose, by drugging the blessed
cup; so dreadful are the ragings of Satan in our corrupt
nature!"</p>

<p>"I can't see into that," said Father Anselmo, still looking
confused.</p>

<p>"Brother," answered Father Johannes, "permit an unworthy
sinner to remind you that you must not try to see
into anything; all that is wanted of you in our most holy
religion is to shut your eyes and believe; all things are
possible to the eye of faith. Now, humanly speaking," he
added, with a peculiarly meaning look, "who would believe
that you kept all the fasts of our order, and all the
extraordinary ones which it hath pleased our blessed Superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
to lay upon us, as you surely do? A worldling might
swear, to look at you, that such flesh and color must come
in some way from good meat and good wine; but we remember
how the three children throve on the pulse and
rejected the meat from the king's table."</p>

<p>The countenance of Father Anselmo expressed both anger
and alarm at this home-thrust, and the changes did not
escape the keen eye of Father Johannes, who went on.</p>

<p>"I directed the eyes of our holy father upon you as a
striking example of the benefits of abstemious living, showing
that the days of miracles are not yet past in the Church,
as some skeptics would have us believe. He seemed to
study you attentively. I have no doubt he will honor you
with some more particular inquiries,&mdash;the blessed saint!"</p>

<p>Father Anselmo turned uneasily on his seat and stealthily
eyed his companion, to see, if possible, how much real
knowledge was expressed by his words, and then answered
on quite another topic.</p>

<p>"How this garden has fallen to decay! We miss old
Father Angelo sorely, who was always trimming and cleaning
it. Our Superior is too heavenly-minded to have much
thought for earthly things, and so it goes."</p>

<p>Father Johannes watched this attempt at diversion with
a glitter of stealthy malice, and, seeming to be absorbed in
contemplation, broke out again exactly where he had left
off on the unwelcome subject.</p>

<p>"I mind me now, Brother Anselmo, that, when you
came out of your cell to prayers, the other night, your
utterance was thick, and your eyes heavy and watery, and
your gait uncertain. One would swear that you had been
drunken with new wine; but we knew it was all the effect
of fasting and devout contemplation, which inebriates the
soul with holy raptures, as happened to the blessed Apostles
on the day of Pentecost. I remarked the same to our
holy father, and he seemed to give it earnest heed, for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
saw him watching you through all the services. How
blessed is such watchfulness!"</p>

<p>"The Devil take him!" said Father Anselmo, suddenly
thrown off his guard; but checking himself, he added,
confusedly,&mdash;"I <span class="locked">mean"&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I understand you, brother," said Father Johannes; "it
is a motion of the old nature not yet entirely subdued. A
little more of the discipline of the lower vaults, which you
have found so precious, will set all that right."</p>

<p>"You would not inform against me?" said Father Anselmo,
with an expression of alarm.</p>

<p>"It would be my duty, I suppose," said Father Johannes,
with a sigh; "but, sinner that I am, I never could
bring my mind to such proceedings with the vigor of our
blessed father. Had I been Superior of the convent, as
was talked of, how differently might things have proceeded!
I should have erred by a sinful laxness. How fortunate
that it was he, instead of such a miserable sinner as myself!"</p>

<p>"Well, tell me, then, Father Johannes,&mdash;for your eyes
are shrewd as a lynx's,&mdash;<i>is</i> our good Superior so perfect
as he seems? or does he have his little private comforts
sometimes, like the rest of us? Nobody, you know, can
stand it to be always on the top round of the ladder to
Paradise. For my part, between you and me, I never believed
all that story they read to us so often about Saint
Simeon Stylites, who passed so many years on the top of
a pillar and never came down. Trust me, the old boy
found his way down sometimes, when all the world was
asleep, and got somebody to do duty for him meantime,
while he took a little something comfortable. Is it not
so?"</p>

<p>"I am told to believe, and I do believe," said Father
Johannes, casting down his eyes, piously; "and, dear brother,
it ill befits a sinner like me to reprove; but it seemeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
to me as if you make too much use of the eyes of carnal
inquiry. Touching the life of our holy father, I cannot
believe the most scrupulous watch can detect anything in
his walk or conversation other than appears in his profession.
His food is next to nothing,&mdash;a little chopped
spinach or some bitter herb cooked without salt for ordinary
days, and on fast days he mingles this with ashes,
according to a saintly rule. As for sleep, I believe he
does without it; for at no time of the night, when I have
knocked at the door of his cell, have I found him sleeping.
He is always at his prayers or breviary. His cell hath
only a rough, hard board for a bed, with a log of rough
wood for a pillow; yet he complains of that as tempting to
indolence."</p>

<p>Father Anselmo shrugged his fat shoulders, ruefully.</p>

<p>"It's all well enough," he said, "for those that want to
take this hard road to Paradise; but why need they drive
the flock up with them?"</p>

<p>"True enough, Brother Anselmo," said Father Johannes;
"but the flock will rejoice in it in the end, doubtless. I
understand he is purposing to draw yet stricter the reins
of discipline. We ought to be thankful."</p>

<p>"Thankful? We can't wink but six times a week
now," said Father Anselmo; "and by and by he won't let
us wink at all."</p>

<p>"Hist! hush! here he comes," said Father Johannes.
"What ails him? he looks wild, like a man distraught."</p>

<p>In a moment more, in fact, Father Francesco strode hastily
through the corridor, with his deep-set eyes dilated
and glittering, and a vivid hectic flush on his hollow
cheeks. He paid no regard to the salutation of the obsequious
monks; in fact, he seemed scarcely to see them,
but hurried in a disordered manner through the passages
and gained the room of his cell, which he shut and locked
with a violent clang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
"What has come over him now?" said Father Anselmo.</p>

<p>Father Johannes stealthily followed some distance, and
then stood with his lean neck outstretched and his head
turned in the direction where the Superior had disappeared.
The whole attitude of the man, with his acute glittering
eye, might remind one of a serpent making an observation
before darting after his prey.</p>

<p>"Something is working him," he said to himself; "what
may it be?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile that heavy oaken door had closed on a narrow
cell, bare of everything which could be supposed to be
a matter of convenience in the abode of a human being.
A table of the rudest and most primitive construction was
garnished with a skull, whose empty eye-holes and grinning
teeth were the most conspicuous objects in the room.
Behind this stood a large crucifix, manifestly the work of
no common master, and bearing evident traces in its workmanship
of Florentine art: it was, perhaps, one of the
relics of the former wealth of the nobleman who had buried
his name and worldly possessions in this living sepulchre.
A splendid manuscript breviary, richly illuminated, lay
open on the table; and the fair fancy of its flowery letters,
the lustre of gold and silver on its pages, formed a singular
contrast to the squalid nakedness of everything else in the
room. This book, too, had been a family heirloom; some
lingering shred of human and domestic affection sheltered
itself under the protection of religion in making it the
companion of his self-imposed life of penance and renunciation.</p>

<p>Father Francesco had just returned from the scene in
the confessional we have already described. That day had
brought to him one of those pungent and vivid inward
revelations which sometimes overset in a moment some
delusion that has been the cherished growth of years.
Henceforth the reign of self-deception was past,&mdash;there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
was no more self-concealment, no more evasion. He loved
Agnes,&mdash;he knew it; he said it over and over again to himself
with a stormy intensity of energy; and in this hour
the whole of his nature seemed to rise in rebellion against
the awful barriers which hemmed in and threatened this
passion. He now saw clearly that all that he had been
calling fatherly tenderness, pastoral zeal, Christian unity,
and a thousand other evangelical names, was nothing more
nor less than a passion that had gone to the roots of existence
and absorbed into itself all that there was of him.
Where was he to look for refuge? What hymn, what
prayer, had he not blent with her image? It was this that
he had given to her as a holy lesson,&mdash;it was that that
she had spoken of to him as the best expression of her
feelings. This prayer he had explained to her; he remembered
just the beautiful light in her eyes, which were
fixed on his so trustingly. How dear to him had been
that unquestioning devotion, that tender, innocent humility!&mdash;how
dear, and how dangerous!</p>

<p>We have read of flowing rivulets, wandering peacefully
without ripple or commotion, so long as no barrier stayed
their course, suddenly chafing in angry fury when an impassable
dam was thrown across their waters. So any
affection, however genial and gentle in its own nature, may
become an ungovernable, ferocious passion, by the intervention
of fatal obstacles in its course. In the case of Father
Francesco, the sense of guilt and degradation fell like a
blight over all the past that had been so ignorantly happy.
He thought he had been living on manna, but found it
poison. Satan had been fooling him, leading him on blindfold,
and laughing at his simplicity, and now mocked at
his captivity. And how nearly had he been hurried by a
sudden and overwhelming influence to the very brink of
disgrace! He felt himself shiver and grow cold to think
of it. A moment more, and he had blasted that pure ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
with forbidden words of passion; and even now he remembered,
with horror, the look of grave and troubled surprise
in those confiding eyes, that had always looked up to him
trustingly, as to God. A moment more, and he had betrayed
the faith he taught her, shattered her trust in the
holy ministry, and perhaps imperiled her salvation. He
breathed a sigh of relief when he thought of it,&mdash;he had
not betrayed himself, he had not fallen in her esteem, he
still stood on that sacred vantage-ground where his power
over her was so great, and where at least he possessed her
confidence and veneration. There was still time for recollection,
for self-control, for a vehement struggle which
should set all right again: but, alas! how shall a man
struggle who finds his whole inner nature boiling in furious
rebellion against the dictates of his conscience,&mdash;self
against self?</p>

<p>It is true, also, that no passions are deeper in their hold,
more pervading and more vital to the whole human being,
than those that make their first entrance through the higher
nature, and, beginning with a religious and poetic ideality,
gradually work their way through the whole fabric of the
human existence. From grosser passions, whose roots lie
in the senses, there is always a refuge in man's loftier
nature. He can cast them aside with contempt, and leave
them as one whose lower story is flooded can remove to
a higher loft, and live serenely with a purer air and wider
prospect. But to love that is born of ideality, of intellectual
sympathy, of harmonies of the spiritual and immortal
natures, of the very poetry and purity of the soul, if it be
placed where reason and religion forbid its exercise and
expression, what refuge but the grave,&mdash;what hope but
that wide eternity where all human barriers fall, all human
relations end, and love ceases to be a crime? A man of
the world may struggle by change of scene, place, and employment.
He may put oceans between himself and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
things that speak of what he desires to forget. He may
fill the void in his life with the stirring excitement of the
battle-field, or the whirl of travel from city to city, or the
press of business and care. But what help is there for
him whose life is tied down to the narrow sphere of the
convent,&mdash;to the monotony of a bare cell, to the endless
repetition of the same prayers, the same chants, the same
prostrations, especially when all that ever redeemed it from
monotony has been that image and that sympathy which
conscience now bids him forget?</p>

<p>When Father Francesco precipitated himself into his
cell and locked the door, it was with the desperation of a
man who flies from a mortal enemy. It seemed to him
that all eyes saw just what was boiling within him,&mdash;that
the wild thoughts that seemed to scream their turbulent
importunities in his ears were speaking so loud that all the
world would hear. He should disgrace himself before the
brethren whom he had so long been striving to bring to
order and to teach the lessons of holy self-control. He
saw himself pointed at, hissed at, degraded, by the very
men who had quailed before his own reproofs; and scarcely,
when he had bolted the door behind him, did he feel himself
safe. Panting and breathless, he fell on his knees before
the crucifix, and, bowing his head in his hands, fell
forward upon the floor. As a spent wave melts at the foot
of a rock, so all his strength passed away, and he lay
awhile in a kind of insensibility,&mdash;a state in which,
though consciously existing, he had no further control over
his thoughts and feelings. In that state of dreamy exhaustion
his mind seemed like a mirror, which, without
vitality or will of its own, simply lies still and reflects the
objects that may pass over it. As clouds sailing in the
heavens cast their images, one after another, on the glassy
floor of a waveless sea, so the scenes of his former life
drifted in vivid pictures athwart his memory. He saw his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
father's palace,&mdash;the wide, cool, marble halls,&mdash;the gardens
resounding with the voices of falling waters. He saw
the fair face of his mother, and played with the jewels
upon her hands. He saw again the picture of himself, in
all the flush of youth and health, clattering on horseback
through the streets of Florence with troops of gay young
friends, now dead to him as he to them. He saw himself
in the bowers of gay ladies, whose golden hair, lustrous
eyes, and siren wiles came back shivering and trembling in
the waters of memory in a thousand undulating reflections.
There were wild revels,&mdash;orgies such as Florence remembers
with shame to this day. There was intermingled the
turbulent din of arms,&mdash;the haughty passion, the sudden
provocation, the swift revenge. And then came the awful
hour of conviction, the face of that wonderful man whose
preaching had stirred all souls; and then those fearful
days of penance,&mdash;that darkness of the tomb,&mdash;that dying
to the world,&mdash;those solemn vows, and the fearful struggles
by which they had been followed.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" he cried, "is it all in vain?&mdash;so many
prayers? so many struggles?&mdash;and shall I fail of salvation
at last?"</p>

<p>He seemed to himself as a swimmer, who, having exhausted
his last gasp of strength in reaching the shore, is
suddenly lifted up on a cruel wave and drawn back into the
deep. There seemed nothing for him but to fold his arms
and sink.</p>

<p>For he felt no strength now to resist, he felt no wish
to conquer; he only prayed that he might lie there and
die. It seemed to him that the love which possessed him
and tyrannized over his very being was a doom,&mdash;a curse
sent upon him by some malignant fate with whose power
it was vain to struggle. He detested his work,&mdash;he detested
his duties,&mdash;he loathed his vows; and there was not
a thing in his whole future to which he looked forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
otherwise than with the extreme of aversion, except one,
to which he clung with a bitter and defiant tenacity,&mdash;the
spiritual guidance of Agnes. Guidance!&mdash;he laughed
aloud, in the bitterness of his soul, as he thought of this.
He was her guide, her confessor; to him she was bound
to reveal every change of feeling; and this love that he too
well perceived rising in her heart for another,&mdash;he would
wring from her own confessions the means to repress and
circumvent it. If she could not be his, he might at least
prevent her from belonging to any other,&mdash;he might at
least keep her always within the sphere of his spiritual
authority. Had he not a right to do this? had he not a
right to cherish an evident vocation,&mdash;a right to reclaim
her from the embrace of an excommunicated infidel, and
present her as a chaste bride at the altar of the Lord?
Perhaps, when that was done, when an irrevocable barrier
should separate her from all possibility of earthly love,
when the awful marriage-vow should have been spoken
which should seal her heart for heaven alone, he might
recover some of the blessed calm which her influence once
brought over him, and these wild desires might cease, and
these feverish pulses be still.</p>

<p>Such were the vague images and dreams of the past and
future that floated over his mind, as he lay in a heavy sort
of lethargy on the floor of his cell, and hour after hour
passed away. It grew afternoon, and the radiance of
evening came on. The window of the cell overlooked the
broad Mediterranean, all one blue glitter of smiles and
sparkles. The white-winged boats were flitting lightly
to and fro, like gauzy-winged insects in the summer air;
the song of the fishermen drawing their nets on the beach
floated cheerily upward. Capri lay like a half-dissolved
opal in shimmering clouds of mist, and Naples gleamed out
pearly clear in the purple distance. Vesuvius, with its
cloud-spotted sides, its garlanded villas and villages, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
silvery crown of vapor, seemed a warm-hearted and genial
old giant lying down in his gorgeous repose, and holding
all things on his heaving bosom in a kindly embrace.</p>

<p>So was the earth flooded with light and glory, that the
tide poured into the cell, giving the richness of an old
Venetian painting to its bare and squalid furniture. The
crucifix glowed along all its sculptured lines with rich
golden hues. The breviary, whose many-colored leaves
fluttered as the wind from the sea drew inward, was yet
brighter in its gorgeous tints. It seemed a sort of devotional
butterfly perched before the grinning skull, which
was bronzed by the enchanted light into warmer tones of
color, as if some remembrance of what once it saw and felt
came back upon it. So, also, the bare, miserable board
which served for the bed, and its rude pillow, were glorified.
A stray sunbeam, too, fluttered down on the floor
like a pitying spirit, to light up that pale, thin face, whose
classic outlines had now a sharp, yellow setness, like that
of swooning or death; it seemed to linger compassionately
on the sunken, wasted cheeks, on the long black lashes
that fell over the deep hollows beneath the eyes like a
funereal veil. Poor man! lying crushed and torn, like a
piece of rockweed wrenched from its rock by a storm, and
thrown up withered upon the beach!</p>

<p>From the leaves of the breviary there depends, by a
fragment of gold braid, a sparkling something that wavers
and glitters in the evening light. It is a cross of the
cheapest and simplest material, that once belonged to
Agnes. She lost it from her rosary at the confessional,
and Father Francesco saw it fall, yet would not warn her
of the loss, for he longed to possess something that had
belonged to her. He made it a mark to one of her favorite
hymns; but she never knew where it had gone. Little
could she dream, in her simplicity, what a power she held
over the man who seemed to her an object of such awful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
veneration. Little did she dream that the poor little tinsel
cross had such a mighty charm with it, and that she herself,
in her childlike simplicity, her ignorant innocence,
her peaceful tenderness and trust, was raising such a turbulent
storm of passion in the heart which she supposed to
be above the reach of all human changes.</p>

<p>And now, through the golden air, the Ave Maria is
sounding from the convent-bells, and answered by a thousand
tones and echoes from the churches of the old town,
and all Christendom gives a moment's adoring pause to
celebrate the moment when an angel addressed to a mortal
maiden words that had been wept and prayed for during
thousands of years. Dimly they sounded through his ear,
in that half-deadly trance,&mdash;not with plaintive sweetness
and motherly tenderness, but like notes of doom and vengeance.
He felt rebellious impulses within, which rose up
in hatred against them, and all that recalled to his mind
the faith which seemed a tyranny, and the vows which
appeared to him such a hopeless and miserable failure.</p>

<p>But now there came other sounds nearer and more
earthly. His quickened senses perceive a busy patter of
sandaled feet outside his cell, and a whispering of consultation,&mdash;and
then the silvery, snaky tones of Father Johannes,
which had that oily, penetrative quality which
passes through all substances with such distinctness.</p>

<p>"Brethren," he said, "I feel bound in conscience to
knock. Our blessed Superior carries his mortifications altogether
too far. His faithful sons must beset him with
filial inquiries."</p>

<p>The condition in which Father Francesco was lying, like
many abnormal states of extreme exhaustion, seemed to be
attended with a mysterious quickening of the magnetic
forces and intuitive perceptions. He felt the hypocrisy of
those tones, and they sounded in his ear like the suppressed
hiss of a deadly serpent. He had always suspected that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
this man hated him to the death; and he felt now that he
was come with his stealthy tread and his almost supernatural
power of prying observation, to read the very inmost
secrets of his heart. He knew that he longed for nothing
so much as the power to hurl him from his place and to
reign in his stead; and the instinct of self-defense roused
him. He started up as one starts from a dream, waked by
a whisper in the ear, and, raising himself on his elbow,
looked towards the door.</p>

<p>A cautious rap was heard, and then a pause. Father
Francesco smiled with a peculiar and bitter expression.
The rap became louder, more energetic, stormy at last, intermingled
with vehement calls on his name.</p>

<p>Father Francesco rose at length, settled his garments,
passed his hands over his brow, and then, composing himself
to an expression of deliberate gravity, opened the door
and stood before them.</p>

<p>"Holy father," said Father Johannes, "the hearts of
your sons have been saddened. A whole day have you
withdrawn your presence from our devotions. We feared
you might have fainted, your pious austerities so often
transcend the powers of Nature."</p>

<p>"I grieve to have saddened the hearts of such affectionate
sons," said the Superior, fixing his eye keenly on Father
Johannes; "but I have been performing a peculiar
office of prayer to-day for a soul in deadly peril, and have
been so absorbed therein that I have known nothing that
passed. There is a soul among us, brethren," he added,
"that stands at this moment so near to damnation that
even the most blessed Mother of God is in doubt for its
salvation, and whether it can be saved at all, God only
knows."</p>

<p>These words, rising up from a tremendous groundswell
of repressed feeling, had a fearful, almost supernatural earnestness
that made the body of the monks tremble. Most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
of them were conscious of living but a shabby, shambling,
dissembling life, evading in every possible way the efforts
of their Superior to bring them up to the requirements of
their profession; and therefore, when these words were
bolted out among them with such a glowing intensity, every
one of them began mentally feeling for the key of his own
private and interior skeleton-closet, and wondering which
of their ghastly occupants was coming to light now.</p>

<p>Father Johannes alone was unmoved, because he had
long since ceased to have a conscience. A throb of moral
pulsation had for years been an impossibility to the dried
and hardened fibre of his inner nature. He was one of
those real, genuine, thorough unbelievers in all religion and
all faith and all spirituality, whose unbelief grows only
more callous by the constant handling of sacred things.
Ambition was the ruling motive of his life, and every faculty
was sharpened into such acuteness under its action that
his penetration seemed at times almost preternatural.</p>

<p>While he stood with downcast eyes and hands crossed
upon his breast, listening to the burning words which remorse
and despair wrung from his Superior, he was calmly
and warily studying to see what could be made of the evident
interior conflict that convulsed him. Was there some
secret sin? Had that sanctity at last found the temptation
that was more than a match for it? And what could
it be?</p>

<p>To a nature with any strong combative force there is no
tonic like the presence of a secret and powerful enemy, and
the stealthy glances of Father Johannes's serpent eye did
more towards restoring Father Francesco to self-mastery
than the most conscientious struggles could have done.
He grew calm, resolved, determined. Self-respect was dear
to him,&mdash;and dear to him no less that reflection of self-respect
which a man reads in other eyes. He would not
forfeit his conventual honor, or bring a stain on his order,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
or, least of all, expose himself to the scoffing eye of a triumphant
enemy. Such were the motives that now came
to his aid, while as yet the whole of his inner nature rebelled
at the thought that he must tear up by the roots and
wholly extirpate this love that seemed to have sent its fine
fibres through every nerve of his being. "No!" he said
to himself, with a fierce interior rebellion, "<i>that</i> I will
not do! Right or wrong, come heaven, come hell, I <i>will</i>
love her: and if lost I must be, lost I will be!" And
while this determination lasted, prayer seemed to him a
mockery. He dared not pray alone now, when most he
needed prayer; but he moved forward with dignity towards
the convent chapel to lead the vesper devotions of his
brethren. Outwardly he was calm and rigid as a statue; but
as he commenced the service, his utterance had a terrible
meaning and earnestness that were felt even by the most
drowsy and leaden of his flock. It is singular how the
dumb, imprisoned soul, locked within the walls of the
body, sometimes gives such a piercing power to the tones of
the voice during the access of a great agony. The effect
is entirely involuntary and often against the most strenuous
opposition of the will, but one sometimes hears another
reading or repeating words with an intense vitality, a living
force, which tells of some inward anguish or conflict of
which the language itself gives no expression.</p>

<p>Never were the long-drawn intonations of the chants
and prayers of the Church pervaded by a more terrible,
wild fervor than the Superior that night breathed into
them. They seemed to wail, to supplicate, to combat, to
menace, to sink in despairing pauses of helpless anguish,
and anon to rise in stormy agonies of passionate importunity;
and the monks quailed and trembled, they scarce
knew why, with forebodings of coming wrath and judgment.</p>

<p>In the evening exhortation, which it had been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
Superior's custom to add to the prayers of the vesper-hour,
he dwelt with a terrible and ghastly eloquence on the loss
of the soul.</p>

<p>"Brethren," he said, "believe me, the very first hour of
a damned spirit in hell will outweigh all the prosperities
of the most prosperous life. If you could gain the whole
world, that one hour of hell would outweigh it all; how
much more such miserable, pitiful scraps and fragments of
the world as they gain who for the sake of a little fleshly
ease neglect the duties of a holy profession! There is a
broad way to hell through a convent, my brothers, where
miserable wretches go who have neither the spirit to serve
the Devil wholly, nor the patience to serve God; there be
many shaven crowns that gnash their teeth in hell to-night,&mdash;many
a monk's robe is burning on its owner in living
fire, and the devils call him a fool for choosing to be
damned in so hard a way. 'Could you not come here by
some easier road than a cloister?' they ask. 'If you must
sell your soul, why did you not get something for it?'
Brethren, there be devils waiting for some of us; they are
laughing at your paltry shifts and evasions, at your efforts
to make things easy,&mdash;for they know how it will all end
at last. Rouse yourselves! Awake! Salvation is no easy
matter,&mdash;nothing to be got between sleeping and waking.
Watch, pray, scourge the flesh, fast, weep, bow down in
sackcloth, mingle your bread with ashes, if by any means
ye may escape the everlasting fire!"</p>

<p>"Bless me!" said Father Anselmo, when the services
were over, casting a half-scared glance after the retreating
figure of the Superior as he left the chapel, and drawing a
long breath; "it's enough to make one sweat to hear him
go on. What has come over him? Anyhow, I'll give
myself a hundred lashes this very night: something must
be done."</p>

<p>"Well," said another, "I confess I did hide a cold wing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
of fowl in the sleeve of my gown last fast-day. My old
aunt gave it to me, and I was forced to take it for relation's
sake; but I'll do so no more, as I'm a living sinner
I'll do a penance this very night."</p>

<p>Father Johannes stood under one of the arches that
looked into the gloomy garden, and, with his hands crossed
upon his breast, and his cold, glittering eye fixed stealthily
now on one and now on another, listened with an ill-disguised
sneer to these hasty evidences of fear and remorse in
the monks, as they thronged the corridor on the way to
their cells. Suddenly turning to a young brother who had
lately joined the convent, he said to <span class="locked">him,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"And what of the pretty Clarice, my brother?"</p>

<p>The blood flushed deep into the pale cheek of the young
monk, and his frame shook with some interior emotion as
he <span class="locked">answered,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"She is recovering."</p>

<p>"And she sent for thee to shrive her?"</p>

<p>"My God!" said the young man, with an imploring,
wild expression in his dark eyes, "she did; but I would
not go."</p>

<p>"Then Nature is still strong," said Father Johannes,
pitilessly eyeing the young man.</p>

<p>"When will it ever die?" said the stripling, with a
despairing gesture; "it heeds neither heaven nor hell."</p>

<p>"Well, patience, boy! if you have lost an earthly bride,
you have gained a heavenly one. The Church is our espoused
in white linen. Bless the Lord, without ceasing,
for the exchange."</p>

<p>There was an inexpressible mocking irony in the tones
in which this was said, that made itself felt to the finely
vitalized spirit of the youth, though to all the rest it
sounded like the accredited average pious talk which is
more or less the current coin of religious organizations.</p>

<p>Now no one knows through what wanton deviltry Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Johannes broached this painful topic with the poor youth;
but he had a peculiar faculty, with his smooth tones and
his sanctimonious smiles, of thrusting red-hot needles into
any wounds which he either knew or suspected under the
coarse woolen robes of his brethren. He appeared to do
it in all coolness, in a way of psychological investigation.</p>

<p>He smiled, as the youth turned away, and a moment
after, started as if a thought had suddenly struck him.</p>

<p>"I have it!" he said to himself. "There may be a
woman at the bottom of this discomposure of our holy father;
for he is wrought upon by something to the very
bottom of his soul. I have not studied human nature so
many years for nothing. Father Francesco hath been
much in the guidance of women. His preaching hath
wrought upon them, and perchance among them. Aha!"
he said to himself, as he paced up and down. "I have it!
I'll try an experiment upon him!"</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<h2 class="vspace2"><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />

<span class="smaller">THE SERPENT'S EXPERIMENT</span></h2>

<p>Father Francesco sat leaning his head on his hand
by the window of his cell, looking out upon the sea as it
rose and fell, with the reflections of the fast coming stars
glittering like so many jewels on its breast. The glow of
evening had almost faded, but there was a wan, tremulous
light from the moon, and a clearness produced by the reflection
of such an expanse of water, which still rendered
objects in his cell quite discernible.</p>

<p>In the terrible denunciations and warnings just uttered,
he had been preaching to himself, striving to bring a force
on his own soul by which he might reduce its interior rebellion
to submission; but, alas! when was ever love cast
out by fear? He knew not as yet the only remedy for
such sorrow,&mdash;that there is a love celestial and divine, of
which earthly love in its purest form is only the sacramental
symbol and emblem, and that this divine love can
by God's power so outflood human affections as to bear the
soul above all earthly idols to its only immortal rest. This
great truth rises like a rock amid stormy seas, and many is
the sailor struggling in salt and bitter waters who cannot
yet believe it is to be found. A few saints like Saint
Augustine had reached it,&mdash;but through what buffetings,
what anguish!</p>

<p>At this moment, however, there was in the heart of the
father one of those collapses which follow the crisis of some
mortal struggle. He leaned on the window-sill, exhausted
and helpless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
Suddenly, a kind of illusion of the senses came over
him, such as is not infrequent to sensitive natures in severe
crises of mental anguish. He thought he heard Agnes
singing, as he had sometimes heard her when he had called
in his pastoral ministrations at the little garden and paused
awhile outside that he might hear her finish a favorite
hymn, which, like a shy bird, she sung all the more
sweetly for thinking herself alone.</p>

<p>Quite as if they were sung in his ear, and in her very
tones, he heard the words of Saint Bernard, which we have
already introduced to our <span class="locked">reader:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container" xml:lang="la" lang="la">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Jesu dulcis memoria,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dans vera cordi gaudia:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sed super mel et omnia<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ejus dulcis præsentia.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Jesu, spes p&oelig;nitentibus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quam pius es petentibus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quam bonus te quærentibus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sed quis invenientibus!"<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Soft and sweet and solemn was the illusion, as if some
spirit breathed them with a breath of tenderness over his
soul; and he threw himself with a burst of tears before the
crucifix.</p>

<p>"O Jesus, where, then, art Thou? Why must I thus
suffer? She is not the one altogether lovely; it is Thou,&mdash;Thou,
her Creator and mine. Why, why cannot I find
Thee? Oh, take from my heart all other love but Thine
alone!"</p>

<p>Yet even this very prayer, this very hymn, were blent
with the remembrance of Agnes; for was it not she who
first had taught him the lesson of heavenly love? Was
not she the first one who had taught him to look upward
to Jesus other than as an avenging judge? Michel Angelo
has embodied in a fearful painting, which now deforms the
Sistine Chapel, that image of stormy vengeance which a
religion debased by force and fear had substituted for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
tender, good shepherd of earlier Christianity. It was only
in the heart of a lowly maiden that Christ had been made
manifest to the eye of the monk, as of old he was revealed
to the world through a virgin. And how could he, then,
forget her, or cease to love her, when every prayer and
hymn, every sacred round of the ladder by which he must
climb, was so full of memorials of her? While crying and
panting for the supreme, the divine, the invisible love, he
found his heart still craving the visible one,&mdash;the one so
well known, revealing itself to the senses, and bringing
with it the certainty of visible companionship.</p>

<p>As he was thus kneeling and wrestling with himself, a
sudden knock at his door startled him. He had made it
a point, never, at any hour of the day or night, to deny
himself to a brother who sought him for counsel, however
disagreeable the person and however unreasonable the visit.
He therefore rose and unbolted the door, and saw Father
Johannes standing with folded arms and downcast head, in
an attitude of composed humility.</p>

<p>"What would you with me, brother?" he asked, calmly.</p>

<p>"My father, I have a wrestling of mind for one of our
brethren whose case I would present to you."</p>

<p>"Come in, my brother," said the Superior. At the
same time he lighted a little iron lamp, of antique form,
such as are still in common use in that region, and seating
himself on the board which served for his couch, made a
motion to Father Johannes to be seated also.</p>

<p>The latter sat down, eyeing, as he did so, the whole interior
of the apartment, so far as it was revealed by the
glimmer of the taper.</p>

<p>"Well, my son," said Father Francesco, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"I have my doubts of the spiritual safety of Brother
Bernard," said Father Johannes.</p>

<p>"Wherefore?" asked the Superior, briefly.</p>

<p>"Holy father, you are aware of the history of the brother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
and of the worldly affliction that drove him to this
blessed profession?"</p>

<p>"I am," replied the Superior, with the same brevity.</p>

<p>"He narrated it to me fully," said Father Johannes.
"The maiden he was betrothed to was married to another
in his absence on a long journey, being craftily made to
suppose him dead."</p>

<p>"I tell you I know the circumstances," said the Superior.</p>

<p>"I merely recalled them, because, moved doubtless by
your sermon, he dropped words to me to-night which led
me to suppose that this sinful, earthly love was not yet
extirpated from his soul. Of late the woman was sick and
nigh unto death, and sent for him."</p>

<p>"But he did not go?" interposed Father Francesco.</p>

<p>"No, he did not,&mdash;grace was given him thus far; but
he dropped words to me to the effect, that in secret he still
cherished the love of this woman; and the awful words
your Reverence has been speaking to us to-night have
moved me with fear for the youth's soul, of the which I,
as an elder brother, have had some charge, and I came to
consult with you as to what help there might be for him."</p>

<p>Father Francesco turned away his head a moment and
there was a pause; at last he said, in a tone that seemed
like the throb of some deep, interior <span class="locked">anguish,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"The Lord help him!"</p>

<p>"Amen!" said Father Johannes, taking keen note of
the apparent emotion.</p>

<p>"You must have experience in these matters, my father,"
he added, after a pause,&mdash;"so many hearts have been laid
open to you. I would crave to know of you what you
think is the safest and most certain cure for this love of
woman, if once it hath got possession of the heart."</p>

<p>"<i>Death!</i>" said Father Francesco, after a solemn pause.</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," said Father Johannes.</p>

<p>"My son," said Father Francesco, rising up with an air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
of authority, "you do <i>not</i> understand,&mdash;there is nothing in
you by which you should understand. This unhappy brother
hath opened his case to me, and I have counseled him
all I know of prayer and fastings and watchings and mortifications.
Let him persevere in the same; and if all these
fail, the good Lord will send the other in His own time.
There is an end to all things in this life, and that end
shall certainly come at last. Bid him persevere and hope
in this. And now, brother," added the Superior, with
dignity, "if you have no other query, time flies and eternity
comes on,&mdash;go, watch and pray, and leave me to my
prayers, also."</p>

<p>He raised his hand with a gesture of benediction, and
Father Johannes, awed in spite of himself, felt impelled
to leave the apartment.</p>

<p>"Is it so, or is it not?" he said. "I cannot tell. He
did seem to wince and turn away his head when I proposed
the case; but then he made fight at last. I cannot tell
whether I have got any advantage or not; but patience!
we shall see!"</p>

<span class="smaller">ELSIE PUSHES HER SCHEME</span></h2>

<p>The good Father Antonio returned from his conference
with the cavalier with many subjects for grave pondering.
This man, as he conjectured, so far from being an enemy
either of Church or State, was in fact in many respects in
the same position with his revered master,&mdash;as nearly
so as the position of a layman was likely to resemble
that of an ecclesiastic. His denial of the Visible Church, as
represented by the Pope and cardinals, sprang not from an
irreverent, but from a reverent spirit. To accept <i>them</i> as
exponents of Christ and Christianity was to blaspheme and
traduce both, and therefore he only could be counted in
the highest degree Christian who stood most completely
opposed to them in spirit and practice.</p>

<p>His kind and fatherly heart was interested in the brave
young nobleman. He sympathized fully with the situation
in which he stood, and he even wished success to his love;
but then how was he to help him with Agnes, and above
all with her old grandmother, without entering on the
awful task of condemning and exposing that sacred authority
which all the Church had so many years been taught
to regard as infallibly inspired? Long had all the truly
spiritual members of the Church who gave ear to the teachings
of Savonarola felt that the nearer they followed Christ
the more open was their growing antagonism to the Pope
and the Cardinals; but still they hung back from the
responsibility of inviting the people to an open revolt.</p>

<p>Father Antonio felt his soul deeply stirred with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
news of the excommunication of his saintly master; and
he marveled, as he tossed on his restless bed through the
night, how he was to meet the storm. He might have
known, had he been able to look into a crowded assembly
in Florence about this time, when the unterrified monk
thus met the news of his <span class="locked">excommunication:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"There have come decrees from Rome, have there?
They call me a son of perdition. Well, thus may you
answer: He to whom you give this name hath neither
favorites nor concubines, but gives himself solely to preaching
Christ. His spiritual sons and daughters, those who
listen to his doctrine, do not pass their time in infamous
practices. They confess, they receive the communion,
they live honestly. This man gives himself up to exalt
the Church of Christ: you to destroy it. The time approaches
for opening the secret chamber: we will give but
one turn of the key, and there will come out thence such
an infection, such a stench of this city of Rome, that the
odor shall spread through all Christendom, and all the
world shall be sickened."</p>

<p>But Father Antonio was of himself wholly unable to
come to such a courageous result, though capable of following
to the death the master who should do it for him.
His was the true artist nature, as unfit to deal with rough
human forces as a bird that flies through the air is unfitted
to a hand-to-hand grapple with the armed forces of the
lower world. There is strength in these artist natures.
Curious computations have been made of the immense muscular
power that is brought into exercise when a swallow
skims so smoothly through the blue sky; but the strength
is of a kind unadapted to mundane uses, and needs the
ether for its display. Father Antonio could create the
beautiful; he could warm, could elevate, could comfort;
and when a stronger nature went before him, he could follow
with an unquestioning tenderness of devotion: but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
wanted the sharp, downright power of mind that could cut
and cleave its way through the rubbish of the past, when
its institutions, instead of a commodious dwelling, had
come to be a loathsome prison. Besides, the true artist
has ever an enchanted island of his own; and when this
world perplexes and wearies him, he can sail far away and
lay his soul down to rest, as Cytherea bore the sleeping
Ascanius far from the din of battle, to sleep on flowers and
breathe the odor of a hundred undying altars to Beauty.</p>

<p>Therefore, after a restless night, the good monk arose in
the first purple of the dawn, and instinctively betook him
to a review of his drawings for the shrine, as a refuge from
troubled thought. He took his sketch of the Madonna and
Child into the morning twilight and began meditating
thereon, while the clouds that lined the horizon were glowing
rosy purple and violet with the approaching day.</p>

<p>"See there!" he said to himself, "yonder clouds have
exactly the rosy purple of the cyclamen which my little
Agnes loves so much;&mdash;yes, I am resolved that this cloud
on which our Mother standeth shall be of a cyclamen color.
And there is that star, like as it looked yesterday evening,
when I mused upon it. Methought I could see our Lady's
clear brow, and the radiance of her face, and I prayed that
some little power might be given to show forth that which
transports me."</p>

<p>And as the monk plied his pencil, touching here and
there, and elaborating the outlines of his drawing, he
<span class="locked">sung,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>As the monk sung, Agnes soon appeared at the door.</p>

<p>"Ah, my little bird, you are there!" he said looking
up.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Agnes, coming forward, and looking over
his shoulder at his work.</p>

<p>"Did you find that young sculptor?" she asked.</p>

<p>"That I did,&mdash;a brave boy, too, who will row down
the coast and dig us marble from an old heathen temple,
which we will baptize into the name of Christ and his
Mother."</p>

<p>"Pietro was always a good boy," said Agnes.</p>

<p>"Stay," said the monk, stepping into his little sleeping
room; "he sent you this lily; see, I have kept it in water
all night."</p>

<p>"Poor Pietro, that was good of him!" said Agnes. "I
would thank him, if I could. But, uncle," she added, in
a hesitating voice, "did you see anything of that&mdash;other
one?"</p>

<p>"That I did, child,&mdash;and talked long with him."</p>

<p>"Ah, uncle, is there any hope for him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
"Yes, there is hope,&mdash;great hope. In fact, he has
promised to receive me again, and I have hopes of leading
him to the sacrament of confession, and after <span class="locked">that"&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"And then the Pope will forgive him!" said Agnes,
joyfully.</p>

<p>The face of the monk suddenly fell; he was silent, and
went on retouching his drawing.</p>

<p>"Do you not think he will?" said Agnes, earnestly.
"You said the Church was ever ready to receive the repentant."</p>

<p>"The True Church will receive him," said the monk,
evasively; "yes, my little one, there is no doubt of it."</p>

<p>"And it is not true that he is captain of a band of robbers
in the mountains?" said Agnes. "May I tell Father
Francesco that it is not so?"</p>

<p>"Child, this young man hath suffered a grievous wrong
and injustice; for he is lord of an ancient and noble estate,
out of which he hath been driven by the cruel injustice of
a most wicked and abominable man, the Duke di <span class="locked">Valentinos,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span>
who hath caused the death of his brothers and sisters,
and ravaged the country around with fire and sword,
so that he hath been driven with his retainers to a fortress
in the mountains."</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Cæsar Borgia was created Duc de Valentinois by Louis XII. of France.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"But," said Agnes, with flushed cheeks, "why does not
our blessed Father excommunicate this wicked duke?
Surely this knight hath erred; instead of taking refuge in
the mountains, he ought to have fled with his followers to
Rome, where the dear Father of the Church hath a house
for all the oppressed. It must be so lovely to be the
father of all men, and to take in and comfort all those
who are distressed and sorrowful, and to right the wrongs of
all that are oppressed, as our dear Father at Rome doth!"</p>

<p>The monk looked up at Agnes's clear glowing face with
a sort of wondering pity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
"Dear little child," he said, "there is a Jerusalem above
which is mother of us all, and these things are done there.</p>

<p>The face of the monk glowed as he repeated this ancient
hymn of the <span class="locked">Church,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> as if the remembrance of that general

<p>Agnes felt perplexed, and looked earnestly at her uncle
as he stooped over his drawing, and saw that there were
deep lines of anxiety on his usually clear, placid face,&mdash;a
look as of one who struggles mentally with some untold
trouble.</p>

<p>"Uncle," she said, hesitatingly, "may I tell Father
Francesco what you have been telling me of this young
man?"</p>

<p>"No, my little one,&mdash;it were not best. In fact, dear
child, there be many things in his case impossible to explain,
even to you;&mdash;but he is not so altogether hopeless
as you thought; in truth, I have great hopes of him. I
have admonished him to come here no more, but I shall see
him again this evening."</p>

<p>Agnes wondered at the heaviness of her own little heart,
as her kind old uncle spoke of his coming there no more.
Awhile ago she dreaded his visits as a most fearful temptation,
and thought perhaps he might come at any hour; now
she was sure he would not, and it was astonishing what a
weight fell upon her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
"Why am I not thankful?" she asked herself. "Why
am I not joyful? Why should I wish to see him again,
when I should only he tempted to sinful thoughts, and
when my dear uncle, who can do so much for him, has his
soul in charge? And what is this which is so strange in
his case? There is some mystery, after all,&mdash;something,
perhaps, which I ought not to wish to know. Ah, how
little can we know of this great wicked world, and of the
reasons which our superiors give for their conduct! It is
ours humbly to obey, without a question or a doubt. Holy
Mother, may I not sin through a vain curiosity or self-will!
May I ever say, as thou didst, 'Behold the handmaid of
the Lord! be it unto me according to His word!'"</p>

<p>And Agnes went about her morning devotions with fervent
zeal, and did not see the monk as he dropped the
pencil, and, covering his face with his robe, seemed to
wrestle in some agony of prayer.</p>

<p>"Shepherd of Israel," he said, "why hast Thou forgotten
this vine of Thy planting? The boar out of the wood
doth waste it, the wild beast of the field doth devour it.
Dogs have encompassed Thy beloved; the assembly of the
violent have surrounded him. How long, O Lord, holy
and true, dost Thou not judge and avenge?"</p>

<p>"Now, really, brother," said Elsie, coming towards him,
and interrupting his meditations in her bustling, business
way, yet speaking in a low tone that Agnes should not
hear, "I want you to help me with this child in a good
common-sense fashion: none of your high-flying notions
about saints and angels, but a little good common talk for
every-day people that have their bread and salt to look
after. The fact is, brother, this girl must be married. I
went last night to talk with Antonio's mother, and the
way is all open as well as any living girl could desire.
Antonio is a trifle slow, and the high-flying hussies call
him stupid; but his mother says a better son never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
breathed, and he is as obedient to all her orders now as
when he was three years old. And she has laid up plenty
of household stuff for him, and good hard gold pieces to
boot: she let me count them myself, and I showed her that
which I had scraped together, and she counted it, and we
agreed that the children that come of such a marriage
would come into the world with something to stand on.
Now Agnes is fond of you, brother, and perhaps it would
be well for you to broach the subject. The fact is, when
I begin to talk, she gets her arms round my old neck and
falls to weeping and kissing me at such a rate as makes a
fool of me. If the child would only be rebellious, one
could do something; but this love takes all the stiffness
out of one's joints; and she tells me she never wants a
husband, and she will be content to live with me all her
life. The saints know it isn't for my happiness to put her
out of my old arms; but I can't last forever,&mdash;my old
back grows weaker every year; and Antonio has strong
arms to defend her from all these roystering fellows who
fear neither God nor man, and swoop up young maids as
kites do chickens. And then he is as gentle and manageable
as a this-year ox; Agnes can lead him by the horn,&mdash;she
will be a perfect queen over him; for he has been
brought up to mind the women."</p>

<p>"Well, sister," said the monk, "hath our little maid
any acquaintance with this man? Have they ever spoken
together?"</p>

<p>"Not much. I have never brought them to a very close
acquaintance; and that is what is to be done. Antonio is
not much of a talker; to tell the truth, he does not know
as much to say as our Agnes: but the man's place is not
to say fine things, but to do the hard work that shall support
the household."</p>

<p>"Then Agnes hath not even seen him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, at different times I have bid her regard him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
said to her, 'There goes a proper man and a good Christian,&mdash;a
man who minds his work and is obedient to his
old mother: such a man will make a right good husband
for some girl some day.'"</p>

<p>"And did you ever see that her eye followed him with
pleasure?"</p>

<p>"No, neither him nor any other man, for my little
Agnes hath no thought of that kind; but, once married,
she will like him fast enough. All I want is to have you
begin the subject, and get it into her head a little."</p>

<p>Father Antonio was puzzled how to meet this direct
urgency of his sister. He could not explain to her his
own private reasons for believing that any such attempt
would be utterly vain, and only bring needless distress on
his little favorite. He therefore <span class="locked">answered,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"My good sister, all such thoughts lie so far out of the
sphere of us monks, that you could not choose a worse person
for such an errand. I have never had any other communings
with the child than touching the beautiful things
of my art, and concerning hymns and prayers and the
lovely world of saints and angels, where they neither marry
nor are given in marriage; and so I should only spoil your
enterprise, if I should put my unskillful hand to it."</p>

<p>"At any rate," said Elsie, "don't you approve of my
plan?"</p>

<p>"I should approve of anything that would make our
dear little one safe and happy, but I would not force the
matter against her inclinations. You will always regret it,
if you make so good a child shed one needless tear. After
all, sister, what need of haste? 'Tis a young bird yet.
Why push it out of the nest? When once it is gone, you
will never get it back. Let the pretty one have her little
day to play and sing and be happy. Does she not make
this garden a sort of Paradise with her little ways and her
sweet words? Now, my sister, these all belong to you;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
but, once she is given to another, there is no saying what
may come. One thing only may you count on with certainty:
that these dear days, when she is all day by your
side and sleeps in your bosom all night, are over,&mdash;she
will belong to you no more, but to a strange man who
hath neither toiled nor wrought for her, and all her pretty
ways and dutiful thoughts must be for him."</p>

<p>"I know it&mdash;I know it," said Elsie, with a sudden
wrench of that jealous love which is ever natural to strong,
passionate natures. "I'm sure it isn't for my own sake
I urge this. I grudge him the girl. After all, he is but a
stupid head. What has he ever done, that such good fortune
should befall him? He ought to fall down and kiss
the dust of my shoes for such a gift, and I doubt me much
if he will ever think to do it. These men think nothing
too good for them. I believe, if one of the crowned saints
in heaven were offered them to wife, they would think it
all quite natural, and not a whit less than their requirings."</p>

<p>"Well, then, sister," said the monk, soothingly, "why
press this matter? why hurry? The poor little child is
young; let her frisk like a lamb, and dance like a butterfly,
and sing her hymns every day like a bright bird. Surely
the Apostle saith, 'He that giveth his maid in marriage
doeth well, but he that giveth her not doeth better.'"</p>

<p>"But I have opened the subject already to old Meta,"
said Elsie; "and if I don't pursue it, she will take it into
her head that her son is lightly regarded, and then her
back will be up, and one may lose the chance; and on the
whole, considering the money and the fellow, I don't know
a safer way to settle the girl."</p>

<p>"Well, sister, as I have remarked," said the monk, "I
could not order my speech to propose anything of this kind
to a young maid; I should so bungle that I might spoil
all. You must even propose it yourself."</p>

<p>"I would not have undertaken it," said Elsie, "had I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
not been frightened by that hook-nosed old kite of a cavalier
that has been sailing and perching round. We are
two lone women here, and the times are unsettled, and one
never knows, that hath so fair a prize, but she may be carried
off, and then no redress from any quarter."</p>

<p>"You might lodge her in the convent," said the monk.</p>

<p>"Yes, and then, the first thing I should know, they
would have got her away from me entirely. I have been
well pleased to have her much with the sisters hitherto,
because it kept her from hearing the foolish talk of girls
and gallants,&mdash;and such a flower would have had every
wasp and bee buzzing round it. But now the time is
coming to marry her, I much doubt these nuns. There's
old Jocunda is a sensible woman, who knew something of
the world before she went there,&mdash;but the Mother Theresa
knows no more than a baby; and they would take her in,
and make her as white and as thin as that moon yonder
now the sun has risen; and little good should I have of
her, for I have no vocation for the convent,&mdash;it would
kill me in a week. No,&mdash;she has seen enough of the
convent for the present. I will even take the risk of
watching her myself. Little has this gallant seen of her,
though he has tried hard enough! But to-day I may venture
to take her down with me."</p>

<p>Father Antonio felt a little conscience-smitten in listening
to these triumphant assertions of old Elsie; for he
knew that she would pour all her vials of wrath on his
head, did she know, that, owing to his absence from his
little charge, the dreaded invader had managed to have two
interviews with her grandchild, on the very spot that Elsie
deemed the fortress of security; but he wisely kept his own
counsel, believing in the eternal value of silence. In
truth, the gentle monk lived so much in the unreal and
celestial world of Beauty, that he was by no means a skillful
guide for the passes of common life. Love, other than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
that ethereal kind which aspires towards Paradise, was a
stranger to his thoughts, and he constantly erred in attributing
to other people natures and purposes as unworldly
and spiritual as his own. Thus had he fallen, in his utter
simplicity, into the attitude of a go-between protecting the
advances of a young lover with the shadow of his monk's
gown, and he became awkwardly conscious that, if Elsie
should find out the whole truth, there would be no possibility
of convincing her that what had been done in such
sacred simplicity on all sides was not the basest man&oelig;uvring.</p>

<p>Elsie took Agnes down with her to the old stand in the
gateway of the town. On their way, as had probably been
arranged, Antonio met them. We may have introduced
him to the reader before, who likely enough has forgotten
by this time our portraiture; so we shall say again, that
the man was past thirty, tall, straight, well-made, even to
the tapering of his well-formed limbs, as are the generality
of the peasantry of that favored region. His teeth were
white as sea-pearl; his cheek, though swarthy, had a deep,
healthy flush; and his great velvet black eyes looked
straight out from under their long silky lashes, just as do
the eyes of the beautiful oxen of his country, with a languid,
changeless tranquillity, betokening a good digestion,
and a well-fed, kindly animal nature. He was evidently
a creature that had been nourished on sweet juices and
developed in fair pastures, under genial influences of sun
and weather,&mdash;one that would draw patiently in harness,
if required, without troubling his handsome head how he
came there, and, his labor being done, would stretch his
healthy body to rumination, and rest with serene, even
unreflecting quietude.</p>

<p>He had been duly lectured by his mother, this morning,
on the propriety of commencing his wooing, and was coming
towards them with a bouquet in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
"See there," said Elsie, "there is our young neighbor
Antonio coming towards us. There is a youth whom I am
willing you should speak to; none of your ruffian gallants,
but steady as an ox at his work, and as kind at the crib.
Happy will the girl be that gets him for a husband!"</p>

<p>Agnes was somewhat troubled and saddened this morning,
and absorbed in cares quite new to her life before;
but her nature was ever kindly and social, and it had been
laid under so many restrictions by her grandmother's close
method of bringing up, that it was always ready to rebound
in favor of anybody to whom she allowed her to show kindness.
So, when the young man stopped and shyly reached
forth to her a knot of scarlet poppies intermingled with
bright vetches and wild blue larkspurs, she took it graciously,
and, frankly beaming a smile into his face, <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Thank you, my good Antonio!" Then fastening them
in the front of her bodice, "There, they are beautiful!"
she said, looking up with the simple satisfaction of a child.</p>

<p>"They are not half so beautiful as you are," said the
young peasant; "everybody likes you."</p>

<p>"You are very kind, I am sure," said Agnes. "I like
everybody, as far as grandmamma thinks it best."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that," said Antonio, "because then I
hope you will like me."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, certainly, I do; grandmamma says you are
very good, and I like all good people."</p>

<p>"Well, then, pretty Agnes," said the young man, "let
me carry your basket."</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't need to; it does not tire me."</p>

<p>"But I should like to do something for you," insisted
the young man, blushing deeply.</p>

<p>"Well, you may, then," said Agnes, who began to wonder
at the length of time her grandmother allowed this
conversation to go on without interrupting it, as she generally
had done when a young man was in the case. Quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
to her astonishment, her venerable relative, instead of sticking
as close to her as her shadow, was walking forward
very fast without looking behind.</p>

<p>"Now, Holy Mother," said that excellent matron, "do
help this young man to bring this affair out straight, and
give an old woman, who has had a world of troubles, a
little peace in her old age!"</p>

<p>Agnes found herself, therefore, quite unusually situated,
alone in the company of a handsome young man, and apparently
with the consent of her grandmother. Some girls
might have felt emotions of embarrassment, or even alarm,
at this new situation; but the sacred loneliness and seclusion
in which Agnes had been educated had given her a
confiding fearlessness, such as voyagers have found in the
birds of bright foreign islands which have never been invaded
by man. She looked up at Antonio with a pleased,
admiring smile,&mdash;much such as she would have given, if
a great handsome stag, or other sylvan companion, had
stepped from the forest and looked a friendship at her
through his large liquid eyes. She seemed, in an innocent,
frank way, to like to have him walking by her, and thought
him very good to carry her basket,&mdash;though, as she told
him, he need not do it, it did not tire her in the least.</p>

<p>"Nor does it tire me, pretty Agnes," said he, with an
embarrassed laugh. "See what a great fellow I am,&mdash;how
strong! Look,&mdash;I can bend an iron bar in my hands!
I am as strong as an ox,&mdash;and I should like always to use
my strength for you."</p>

<p>"Should you? How very kind of you! It is very
Christian to use one's strength for others, like the good
Saint Christopher."</p>

<p>"But I would use my strength for you because&mdash;I love
you, gentle Agnes!"</p>

<p>"That is right, too," replied Agnes. "We must all
love one another, my good Antonio."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
"You must know what I mean," said the young man.
"I mean that I want to marry you."</p>

<p>"I am sorry for that, Antonio," replied Agnes, gravely,
"because I do not want to marry you. I am never going
to marry anybody."</p>

<p>"Ah, girls always talk so, my mother told me; but nobody
ever heard of a girl that did not want a husband;
that is impossible," said Antonio, with simplicity.</p>

<p>"I believe girls generally do, Antonio; but I do not:
my desire is to go to the convent."</p>

<p>"To the convent, pretty Agnes? Of all things, what
should you want to go to the convent for? You never
had any trouble. You are young, and handsome, and
healthy, and almost any of the fellows would think himself
fortunate to get you."</p>

<p>"I would go there to live for God and pray for souls,"
said Agnes.</p>

<p>"But your grandmother will never let you; she means
you shall marry me. I heard her and my mother talking
about it last night; and my mother bade me come on, for
she said it was all settled."</p>

<p>"I never heard anything of it," said Agnes, now for the
first time feeling troubled. "But, my good Antonio, if
you really do like me and wish me well, you will not want
to distress me?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>"Well, it <i>will</i> distress me very, very much, if you
persist in wanting to marry me, and if you say any more
on the subject."</p>

<p>"Is that really so?" said Antonio, fixing his great velvet
eyes with an honest stare on Agnes.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is so, Antonio; you may rely upon it."</p>

<p>"But look here, Agnes, are you quite sure? Mother
says girls do not always know their mind."</p>

<p>"But I know mine, Antonio. Now you really will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
distress and trouble me very much, if you say anything
more of this sort."</p>

<p>"I declare, I am sorry for it," said the young man.
"Look ye, Agnes, I did not care half as much about it
this morning as I do now. Mother has been saying this
great while that I must have a wife, that she was getting
old; and this morning she told me to speak to you. I
thought you would be all ready,&mdash;indeed I did."</p>

<p>"My good Antonio, there are a great many very handsome
girls who would be glad, I suppose, to marry you.
I believe other girls do not feel as I do. Giulietta used
to laugh and tell me so."</p>

<p>"That Giulietta was a splendid girl," said Antonio.
"She used to make great eyes at me, and try to make me
play the fool; but my mother would not hear of her.
Now she has gone off with a fellow to the mountains."</p>

<p>"Giulietta gone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, haven't you heard of it? She's gone with one
of the fellows of that dashing young robber-captain that
has been round our town so much lately. All the girls are
wild after these mountain fellows. A good, honest boy
like me, that hammers away at his trade, they think nothing
of; whereas one of these fellows with a feather in
his cap has only to twinkle his finger at them, and they
are off like a bird."</p>

<p>The blood rose in Agnes's cheeks at this very unconscious
remark; but she walked along for some time with a
countenance of grave reflection.</p>

<p>They had now gained the street of the city, where old
Elsie stood at a little distance waiting for them.</p>

<p>"Well, Agnes," said Antonio, "so you really are in
earnest?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I am."</p>

<p>"Well, then, let us be good friends, at any rate," said
the young man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
"Oh, to be sure, I will," said Agnes, smiling with all
the brightness her lovely face was capable of. "You
are a kind, good man, and I like you very much. I will
always remember you kindly."</p>

<p>"Well, good-by, then," said Antonio, offering his
hand.</p>

<p>"Good-by," said Agnes, cheerfully giving hers.</p>

<p>Elsie, beholding the cordiality of this parting, comforted
herself that all was right, and ruffled all her feathers with
the satisfied pride of a matron whose family plans are succeeding.</p>

<p>"After all," she said to herself, "brother was right,&mdash;best
let young folks settle these matters themselves. Now
see the advantage of such an education as I have given
Agnes! Instead of being betrothed to a good, honest,
forehanded fellow, she might have been losing her poor
silly heart to some of these lords or gallants who throw
away a girl as one does an orange when they have sucked
it. Who knows what mischief this cavalier might have
done, if I had not been so watchful? Now let him come
prying and spying about, she will have a husband to defend
her. A smith's hammer is better than an old woman's
spindle, any day."</p>

<p>Agnes took her seat with her usual air of thoughtful
gravity, her mind seeming to be intensely preoccupied, and
her grandmother, though secretly exulting in the supposed
cause, resolved not to open the subject with her till they
were at home or alone at night.</p>

<p>"I have my defense to make to Father Francesco, too,"
she said to herself, "for hurrying on this betrothal against
his advice; but one must manage a little with these priests,&mdash;the
saints forgive me! I really think sometimes, because
they can't marry themselves, they would rather see
every pretty girl in a convent than with a husband. It's
natural enough, too. Father Francesco will be like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
rest of the world: when he can't help a thing, he will see
the will of the Lord in it."</p>

<p>Thus prosperously the world seemed to go with old
Elsie. Meantime, when her back was turned, as she was
kneeling over her basket, sorting out lemons, Agnes happened
to look up, and there, just under the arch of the
gateway, where she had seen him the first time, sat the
cavalier on a splendid horse, with a white feather streaming
backward from his black riding-hat and dark curls.</p>

<p>He bowed low and kissed his hand to her, and before
she knew it her eyes met his, which seemed to flash light
and sunshine all through her; and then he turned his horse
and was gone through the gate, while she, filled with self-reproach,
was taking her little heart to task for the instantaneous
throb of happiness which had passed through her
whole being at that sight. She had not turned away her
head nor said a prayer, as Father Francesco told her to do,
because the whole thing had been sudden as a flash; but
now it was gone, she prayed, "My God, help me not to
love him!&mdash;let me love Thee alone!" But many times
in the course of the day, as she twisted her flax, she found
herself wondering whither he could be going. Had he
really gone to that enchanted cloud-land, in the old purple
Apennines, whither he wanted to carry her,&mdash;gone, perhaps,
never to return? That was best. But was he reconciled
with the Church? Was that great, splendid soul that
looked out of those eyes to be forever lost, or would the
pious exhortations of her uncle avail? And then she
thought he had said to her, that, if she would go with
him, he would confess and take the sacrament, and be reconciled
with the Church, and so his soul be saved.</p>

<p>She resolved to tell this to Father Francesco. Perhaps
he would&mdash;No,&mdash;she shivered as she remembered the
severe, withering look with which the holy father had
spoken of him, and the awfulness of his manner,&mdash;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
would never consent. And then her grandmother&mdash;No,
there was no possibility.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Agnes's good old uncle sat in the orange-shaded
garden, busily perfecting his sketches; but his mind
was distracted, and his thoughts wandered,&mdash;and often he
rose, and, leaving his drawings, would pace up and down
the little place, absorbed in earnest prayer. The thought
of his master's position was hourly growing upon him.
The real world with its hungry and angry tide was each
hour washing higher and higher up on the airy shore of
the ideal, and bearing the pearls and enchanted shells of
fancy out into its salt and muddy waters.</p>

<p>"Oh, my master! my father!" he said, "is the martyr's
crown of fire indeed waiting thee? Will God desert His
own? But was not Christ crucified?&mdash;and the disciple is
not above his master, nor the servant above his lord. But
surely Florence will not consent. The whole city will
make a stand for him;&mdash;they are ready, if need be, to
pluck out their eyes and give them to him. Florence will
certainly be a refuge for him. But why do I put confidence
in man? In the Lord alone have I righteousness
and strength."</p>

<p>And the old monk raised the psalm, "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quare fremunt
gentes</i>," and his voice rose and fell through the flowery
recesses and dripping grottoes of the old gorge, sad and
earnest like the protest of the few and feeble of Christ's
own against the rushing legions of the world. Yet, as he
sang, courage and holy hope came into his soul from the
sacred words,&mdash;just such courage as they brought to
Luther and to the Puritans in later times.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MONK'S DEPARTURE</span></h2>

<p>The three inhabitants of the little dove-cot were sitting
in their garden after supper, enjoying the cool freshness.
The place was perfumed with the smell of orange-blossoms,
brought out by gentle showers that had fallen during the
latter part of the afternoon, and all three felt the tranquillizing
effects of the sweet evening air. The monk sat
bending over his drawings, resting the frame on which they
lay on the mossy garden-wall, so as to get the latest advantage
of the rich golden twilight which now twinkled through
the sky. Agnes sat by him on the same wall,&mdash;now
glancing over his shoulder at his work, and now leaning
thoughtfully on her elbow, gazing pensively down into the
deep shadows of the gorge, or out where the golden light
of evening streamed under the arches of the old Roman
bridge, to the wide, bright sea beyond.</p>

<p>Old Elsie bustled about with unusual content in the
lines of her keen, wrinkled face. Already her thoughts
were running on household furnishing and bridal finery.
She unlocked an old chest, which from its heavy, quaint
carvings of dark wood must have been some relic of the
fortunes of her better days, and, taking out of a little till
of the same a string of fine, silvery pearls, held them up
admiringly to the evening light. A splendid pair of pearl
ear-rings also was produced from the same receptacle.</p>

<p>She sighed at first, as she looked at these things, and
then smiled with rather an air of triumph, and, coming to
where Agnes reclined on the wall, held them up playfully
before her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
"See here, little one!" she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, what pretty things!&mdash;where did they come from?"
said Agnes, innocently.</p>

<p>"Where did they? Sure enough! Little did you or
any one else know old Elsie had things like these! But
she meant her little Agnes should hold up her head with
the best. No girl in Sorrento will have such wedding
finery as this!"</p>

<p>"Wedding finery, grandmamma," said Agnes, faintly,
"what does that mean?"</p>

<p>"What does that mean, sly-boots? Ah, you know well
enough! What were you and Antonio talking about all
the time this morning? Did he not ask you to marry
him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, grandmamma; but I told him I was not going to
marry. You promised me, dear grandmother, right here,
the other night, that I should not marry till I was willing;
and I told Antonio I was not willing."</p>

<p>"The girl says but true, sister," said the monk; "you
remember you gave her your word that she should not be
married till she gave her consent willingly."</p>

<p>"But, Agnes, my pretty one, what can be the objection?"
said old Elsie, coaxingly. "Where will you find
a better-made man, or more honest, or more kind?&mdash;and
he is handsome;&mdash;and you will have a home that all the
girls will envy."</p>

<p>"Grandmamma, remember, you promised me,&mdash;you
<i>promised</i> me," said Agnes, looking distressed, and speaking
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Well, well, child! but can't I ask a civil question, if
I did? What is your objection to Antonio?"</p>

<p>"Only that I don't want to be married."</p>

<p>"Now you know, child," said Elsie, "I never will consent
to your going to a convent. You might as well put
a knife through my old heart as talk to me of that. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
if you don't go, you must marry somebody; and who could
be better than Antonio?"</p>

<p>"Oh, grandmamma, am I not a good girl? What have
I done, that you are so anxious to get me away from
you?" said Agnes. "I like Antonio well enough, but I
like you ten thousand times better. Why cannot we live
together just as we do now? I am strong. I can work a
great deal harder than I do. You ought to let me work
more, so that you need not work so hard and tire yourself,&mdash;let
me carry the heavy basket, and dig round the trees."</p>

<p>"Pooh! a pretty story!" said Elsie. "We are two
lone women, and the times are unsettled; there are robbers
and loose fellows about, and we want a protector."</p>

<p>"And is not the good Lord our protector?&mdash;has He not
always kept us, grandmother?" said Agnes.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's well enough to say, but folks can't always
get along so; it's far better trusting the Lord with a
good strong man about,&mdash;like Antonio, for instance. I
should like to see the man that would dare be uncivil to
<i>his</i> wife. But go your ways; it's no use toiling away
one's life for children, who, after all, won't turn their little
finger for you."</p>

<p>"Now, dear grandmother," said Agnes, "have I not said
I would do everything for you, and work hard for you?
Ask me to do anything else in the world, grandmamma; I
will do anything to make you happy, except marry this
man,&mdash;that I cannot."</p>

<p>"And that is the only thing I want you to do. Well,
I suppose I may as well lock up these things; I see my
gifts are not cared for."</p>

<p>And the old soul turned and went in quite testily, leaving
Agnes with a grieved heart, sitting still by her uncle.</p>

<p>"Never weep, little one," said the kind old monk, when
he saw the silent tears falling one after another; "your
grandmother loves you, after all, and will come out of this,
if we are quiet."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
"This is such a beautiful world," said Agnes, "who
would think it would be such a hard one to live in?&mdash;such
battles and conflicts as people have here!"</p>

<p>"You say well, little heart; but great is the glory to be
revealed; so let us have courage."</p>

<p>"Dear uncle, have you heard any ill-tidings of late?"
asked Agnes. "I noticed this morning you were cast
down, and to-night you look so tired and sad."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear child,&mdash;heavy tidings have indeed come.
My dear master at Florence is hard beset by wicked men,
and in great danger,&mdash;in danger, perhaps, of falling a martyr
to his holy zeal for the blessed Jesus and his Church."</p>

<p>"But cannot our holy father, the Pope, protect him?
You should go to Rome directly and lay the case before
him."</p>

<p>"It is not always possible to be protected by the Pope,"
said Father Antonio, evasively. "But I grieve much,
dear child, that I can be with you no longer. I must gird
up my loins and set out for Florence, to see with my own
eyes how the battle is going for my holy master."</p>

<p>"Ah, must I lose you, too, my dear, best friend?" said
Agnes. "What shall I do?"</p>

<p>"Thou hast the same Lord Jesus, and the same dear
Mother, when I am gone. Have faith in God, and cease
not to pray for His Church,&mdash;and for me, too."</p>

<p>"That I will, dear uncle! I will pray for you more
than ever, for prayer now will be all my comfort. But,"
she added, with hesitation, "oh, uncle, you promised to
visit <i>him</i>!"</p>

<p>"Never fear, little Agnes, I will do that. I go to
him this very night,&mdash;now even,&mdash;for the daylight waxes
too scant for me to work longer."</p>

<p>"But you will come back and stay with us to-night,
uncle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will,&mdash;but to-morrow morning I must be up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
and away with the birds; and I have labored hard all day
to finish the drawings for the lad who shall carve the
shrine, that he may busy himself thereon in my absence."</p>

<p>"Then you will come back?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, dear heart, I will come back; of that be
assured. Pray God it be before long, too."</p>

<p>So saying, the good monk drew his cowl over his head,
and, putting his portfolio of drawings under his arm, began
to wend his way towards the old town.</p>

<p>Agnes watched him departing, her heart in a strange
flutter of eagerness and solicitude. What were these dreadful
troubles which were coming upon her good uncle?&mdash;who
those enemies of the Church that beset that saintly
teacher he so much looked up to? And why was lawless
violence allowed to run such riot in Italy, as it had in the
case of the unfortunate cavalier? As she thought things
over, she was burning with a repressed desire to <i>do</i> something
herself to abate these troubles.</p>

<p>"I am not a knight," she said to herself, "and I cannot
fight for the good cause. I am not a priest, and I cannot
argue for it. I cannot preach and convert sinners. What,
then, can I do? I can pray. Suppose I should make a
pilgrimage? Yes,&mdash;that would be a good work, and I
will. I will walk to Rome, praying at every shrine and
holy place; and then, when I come to the Holy City,
whose very dust is made precious with the blood of the
martyrs and saints, I will seek the house of our dear father,
the Pope, and entreat his forgiveness for this poor soul.
He will not scorn me, for he is in the place of the blessed
Jesus, and the richest princess and the poorest maiden are
equal in his sight. Ah, that will be beautiful! Holy
Mother," she said, falling on her knees before the shrine,
"here I vow and promise that I will go praying to the
Holy City. Smile on me and help me!"</p>

<p>And by the twinkle of the flickering lamp which threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
its light upon the picture, Agnes thought surely the placid
face brightened to a tender maternal smile, and her enthusiastic
imagination saw in this an omen of success.</p>

<p>Old Elsie was moody and silent this evening,&mdash;vexed
at the thwarting of her schemes. It was the first time
that the idea had ever gained a foothold in her mind, that
her docile and tractable grandchild could really have for
any serious length of time a will opposed to her own, and
she found it even now difficult to believe it. Hitherto she
had shaped her life as easily as she could mould a biscuit,
and it was all plain sailing before her. The force and
decision of this young will rose as suddenly upon her as
the one rock in the middle of the ocean which a voyager
unexpectedly discovered by striking on it.</p>

<p>But Elsie by no means regarded the game as lost. She
mentally went over the field, considering here and there
what was yet to be done.</p>

<p>The subject had fairly been broached. Agnes had listened
to it, and parted in friendship from Antonio. Now
his old mother must be soothed and pacified; and Antonio
must be made to persevere.</p>

<p>"What is a girl worth that can be won at the first asking?"
quoth Elsie. "Depend upon it, she will fall to
thinking of him, and the next time she sees him she will
give him a good look. The girl never knew what it was
to have a lover. No wonder she doesn't take to it at first;
there's where her bringing up comes in, so different from
other girls'. Courage, Elsie! Nature will speak in its
own time."</p>

<p>Thus soliloquizing, she prepared to go a few steps from
their dwelling, to the cottage of Meta and Antonio, which
was situated at no great distance.</p>

<p>"Nobody will think of coming here this time o' night,"
she said, "and the girl is in for a good hour at least with
her prayers, and so I think I may venture. I don't really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
like to leave her, but it's not a great way, and I shall be
back in a few moments. I want just to put a word into
old Meta's ear, that she may teach Antonio how to demean
himself."</p>

<p>And so the old soul took her spinning and away she
went, leaving Agnes absorbed in her devotions.</p>

<p>The solemn starry night looked down steadfastly on the
little garden. The evening wind creeping with gentle stir
among the orange-leaves, and the falling waters of the
fountain dripping their distant, solitary way down from
rock to rock through the lonely gorge, were the only sounds
that broke the stillness.</p>

<p>The monk was the first of the two to return; for those
accustomed to the habits of elderly cronies on a gossiping
expedition of any domestic importance will not be surprised
that Elsie's few moments of projected talk lengthened imperceptibly
into hours.</p>

<p>Agnes came forward anxiously to meet her uncle. He
seemed wan and haggard, and trembling with some recent
emotion.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, dear uncle?" she asked.
"Has anything happened?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, child, nothing. I have only been talking on
painful subjects, deep perplexities, out of which I can
scarcely see my way. Would to God this night of life
were past, and I could see morning on the mountains!"</p>

<p>"My uncle, have you not, then, succeeded in bringing
this young man to the bosom of the True Church?"</p>

<p>"Child, the way is hedged up, and made almost impassable
by difficulties you little wot of. They cannot be
told to you; they are enough to destroy the faith of the
very elect."</p>

<p>Agnes's heart sank within her; and the monk, sitting
down on the wall of the garden, clasped his hands over one
knee and gazed fixedly before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
The sight of her uncle,&mdash;generally so cheerful, so elastic,
so full of bright thoughts and beautiful words,&mdash;so
utterly cast down, was both a mystery and a terror to
Agnes.</p>

<p>"Oh, my uncle," she said, "it is hard that I must not
know, and that I can do nothing, when I feel ready to die
for this cause! What is one little life? Ah, if I had a
thousand to give, I could melt them all into it, like little
drops of rain in the sea! Be not utterly cast down, good
uncle! Does not our dear Lord and Saviour reign in the
heavens yet?"</p>

<p>"Sweet little nightingale!" said the monk, stretching
his hand towards her. "Well did my master say that he
gained strength to his soul always by talking with Christ's
little children!"</p>

<p>"And all the dear saints and angels, they are not dead
or idle either," said Agnes, her face kindling: "they are
busy all around us. I know not what this trouble is you
speak of; but let us think what legions of bright angels
and holy men and women are caring for us."</p>

<p>"Well said, well said, dear child! There is, thank
God, a Church Triumphant,&mdash;a crowned queen, a glorious
bride; and the poor, struggling Church Militant shall rise
to join her! What matter, then, though our way lie
through dungeon and chains, through fire and sword, if we
may attain to that glory at last?"</p>

<p>"Uncle, are there such dreadful things really before
you?"</p>

<p>"There may be, child. I say of my master, as did the
holy Apostles: 'Let us also go, that we may die with
him.' I feel a heavy presage. But I must not trouble
you, child. Early in the morning I will be up and away.
I go with this youth, whose pathway lies a certain distance
along mine, and whose company I seek for his good as well
as my pleasure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
"You go with <i>him</i>?" said Agnes, with a start of surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes; his refuge in the mountains lies between here
and Rome, and he hath kindly offered to bring me on my
way faster than I can go on foot; and I would fain see our
beautiful Florence as soon as may be. O Florence, Florence,
Lily of Italy! wilt thou let thy prophet perish?"</p>

<p>"But, uncle, if he die for the faith, he will be a blessed
martyr. That crown is worth dying for," said Agnes.</p>

<p>"You say well, little one,&mdash;you say well! '<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ex oribus
parvulorum.</i>' But one shrinks from that in the person of
a friend which one could cheerfully welcome for one's self.
Oh, the blessed cross! never is it welcome to the flesh,
and yet how joyfully the spirit may walk under it!"</p>

<p>"Dear uncle, I have made a solemn vow before our Holy
Mother this night," said Agnes, "to go on a pilgrimage to
Rome, and at every shrine and holy place to pray that
these great afflictions which beset all of you may have a
happy issue."</p>

<p>"My sweet heart, what have you done? Have you considered
the unsettled roads, the wild, unruly men that are
abroad, the robbers with which the mountains are filled?"</p>

<p>"These are all Christ's children and my brothers," said
Agnes; "for them was the most holy blood shed, as well
as for me. They cannot harm one who prays for them."</p>

<p>"But, dear heart of mine, these ungodly brawlers think
little of prayer; and this beautiful, innocent little face will
but move the vilest and most brutal thoughts and deeds."</p>

<p>"Saint Agnes still lives, dear uncle,&mdash;and He who kept
her in worse trial. I shall walk through them all pure as
snow,&mdash;I am assured I shall. The star which led the
wise men and stood over the young child and his mother
will lead me, too."</p>

<p>"But your grandmother?"</p>

<p>"The Lord will incline her heart to go with me. Dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
uncle, it does not beseem a child to reflect on its elders,
yet I cannot but see that grandmamma loves this world and
me too well for her soul's good. This journey will be for
her eternal repose."</p>

<p>"Well, well, dear one, I cannot now advise. Take advice
of your confessor, and the blessed Lord and his holy
Mother be with you! But come now, I would soothe myself
to sleep; for I have need of good rest to-night. Let
us sing together our dear master's hymn of the Cross."</p>

<p>And the monk and the maiden sung <span class="locked">together:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>As the monk sung, his soul seemed to fuse itself into
the sentiment with that natural grace peculiar to his nation.
He walked up and down the little garden, apparently forgetful
of Agnes or of any earthly presence, and in the last
verses stretched his hands towards heaven with streaming
tears and a fervor of utterance indescribable.</p>

<p>The soft and passionate tenderness of the Italian words
must exhale in an English translation, but enough may
remain to show that the hymns with which Savonarola at
this time sowed the mind of Italy often mingled the Moravian
quaintness and energy with the Wesleyan purity and
tenderness. One of the great means of popular reform
which he proposed was the supplanting of the obscene and
licentious songs, which at that time so generally defiled the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>minds of the young, by religious words and melodies. The
children and young people brought up under his influence
were sedulously stored with treasures of sacred melody, as
the safest companions of leisure hours, and the surest guard
against temptation.</p>

<p>"Come now, my little one," said the monk, after they
had ceased singing, as he laid his hand on Agnes's head.
"I am strong now; I know where I stand. And you, my
little one, you are one of my master's 'Children of the
Cross.' You must sing the hymns of our dear master, that
I taught you, when I am far away. A hymn is a singing
angel, and goes walking through the earth, scattering the
devils before it. Therefore he who creates hymns imitates
the most excellent and lovely works of our Lord God, who
made the angels. These hymns watch our chamber-door,
they sit upon our pillow, they sing to us when we awake;
and therefore our master was resolved to sow the minds of
his young people with them, as our lovely Italy is sown
with the seeds of all colored flowers. How lovely has it
often been to me, as I sat at my work in Florence, to hear
the little children go by, chanting of Jesus and Mary,&mdash;and
young men singing to young maidens, not vain flatteries
of their beauty, but the praises of the One only Beautiful,
whose smile sows heaven with stars like flowers! Ah,
in my day I have seen blessed times in Florence! Truly
was she worthy to be called the Lily City!&mdash;for all her
care seemed to be to make white her garments to receive
her Lord and Bridegroom. Yes, though she had sinned
like the Magdalen, yet she loved much, like her. She
washed His feet with her tears, and wiped them with the
hair of her head. Oh, my beautiful Florence, be true to
thy vows, be true to thy Lord and Governor, Jesus Christ,
and all shall be well!"</p>

<p>"Amen, dear uncle!" said Agnes. "I will not fail to
pray day and night, that thus it may be. And now, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
must travel so far, you must go to rest. Grandmamma has
gone long ago. I saw her steal by as we were singing."</p>

<p>"And is there any message from my little Agnes to this
young man?" asked the monk.</p>

<p>"Yes. Say to him that Agnes prays daily that he may
be a worthy son and soldier of the Lord Jesus."</p>

<p>"Amen, sweet heart! Jesus and His sweet Mother
bless thee!"</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PENANCE</span></h2>

<p>The course of our story requires us to return to the
Capuchin convent, and to the struggles and trials of its
Superior; for in his hands is the irresistible authority
which must direct the future life of Agnes.</p>

<p>From no guilty compliances, no heedless running into
temptation, had he come to love her. The temptation had
met him in the direct path of duty; the poison had been
breathed in with the perfume of sweetest and most life-giving
flowers: nor could he shun that temptation, nor cease
to inhale that fatal sweetness, without confessing himself
vanquished in a point where, in his view, to yield was to
be lost. The subtle and deceitful visit of Father Johannes
to his cell had the effect of thoroughly rousing him to a
complete sense of his position, and making him feel the
immediate, absolute necessity of bringing all the energy of
his will, all the resources of his nature, to bear on its
present difficulties. For he felt, by a fine intuition, that
already he was watched and suspected; any faltering step
now, any wavering, any change in his mode of treating his
female penitents, would be maliciously noted. The military
education of his early days had still left in his mind
a strong residuum of personal courage and honor, which
made him regard it as dastardly to flee when he ought to
conquer, and therefore he set his face as a flint for victory.</p>

<p>But reviewing his interior world, and taking a survey
of the work before him, he felt that sense of a divided
personality which often becomes so vivid in the history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
individuals of strong will and passion. It seemed to him
that there were two men within him: the one turbulent,
passionate, demented; the other vainly endeavoring by authority,
reason, and conscience to bring the rebel to subjection.
The discipline of conventual life, the extraordinary
austerities to which he had condemned himself, the monotonous
solitude of his existence, all tended to exalt the
vivacity of the nervous system, which, in the Italian constitution,
is at all times disproportionately developed; and
when those weird harp-strings of the nerves are once thoroughly
unstrung, the fury and tempest of the discord sometimes
utterly bewilders the most practiced self-government.</p>

<p>But he felt that <i>something</i> must be done with himself,
and done immediately; for in a few days he must again
meet Agnes at the confessional. He must meet her, not
with weak tremblings and passionate fears, but calm as
Fate, inexorable as the Judgment-Day. He must hear her
confession, not as man, but as God; he must pronounce his
judgments with a divine dispassionateness. He must dive
into the recesses of her secret heart, and, following with
subtile analysis all the fine courses of those fibres which
were feeling their blind way towards an earthly love, must
tear them remorselessly away. Well could he warn her of
the insidiousness of earthly affections; better than any one
else he could show her how a name that was blended with
her prayers and borne before the sacred shrine in her most
retired and solemn hours might at last come to fill all her
heart with a presence too dangerously dear. He must
direct her gaze up those mystical heights where an unearthly
marriage awaited her, its sealed and spiritual bride;
he must hurry her footsteps onward to the irrevocable
issue.</p>

<p>All this was before him. But ere it could be done, he
must subdue himself,&mdash;he must become calm and pulseless,
in deadly resolve; and what prayer, what penance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
might avail for this? If all that he had already tried had
so miserably failed, what hope? He resolved to quit for
a season all human society, and enter upon one of those
desolate periods of retreat from earthly converse well known
in the annals of saintship as most prolific in spiritual victories.</p>

<p>Accordingly, on the day after the conversation with
Father Johannes, he startled the monks by announcing to
them that he was going to leave them for several days.</p>

<p>"My brothers," he said, "the weight of a fearful penance
is laid upon me, which I must work out alone. I
leave you to-day, and charge you not to seek to follow my
footsteps; but, as you hope to escape hell, watch and
wrestle for me and yourselves during the time I am gone.
Before many days I hope to return to you with renewed
spiritual strength."</p>

<p>That evening, while Agnes and her uncle were sitting
together in their orange-garden, mingling their parting
prayers and hymns, scenes of a very different description
surrounded the Father Francesco.</p>

<p>One who looks on the flowery fields and blue seas of this
enchanting region thinks that the Isles of the Blest could
scarcely find on earth a more fitting image; nor can he
realize, till experience proves it to him, that he is in the
immediate vicinity of a weird and dreary region which
might represent no less the goblin horrors of the damned.</p>

<p>Around the foot of Vesuvius lie fair villages and villas,
garlanded with roses and flushing with grapes, whose juice
gains warmth from the breathing of its subterraneous fires,
while just above them rises a region more awful than can
be created by the action of any common causes of sterility.
There, immense tracts sloping gradually upward show a
desolation so peculiar, so utterly unlike every common solitude
of Nature, that one enters upon it with the shudder
we give at that which is wholly unnatural. On all sides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
are gigantic serpent convolutions of black lava, their immense
folds rolled into every conceivable contortion, as if,
in their fiery agonies, they had struggled and wreathed and
knotted together, and then grown cold and black with the
imperishable signs of those terrific convulsions upon them.
Not a blade of grass, not a flower, not even the hardiest
lichen, springs up to relieve the utter deathliness of the
scene. The eye wanders from one black, shapeless mass
to another, and there is ever the same suggestion of hideous
monster life, of goblin convulsions and strange fiend-like
agonies in some age gone by. One's very footsteps have
an unnatural, metallic clink, and one's garments brushing
over the rough surface are torn and fretted by its sharp,
remorseless touch, as if its very nature were so pitiless
and acrid that the slightest contact revealed it.</p>

<p>The sun was just setting over the beautiful Bay of
Naples,&mdash;with its enchanted islands, its jeweled city, its
flowery villages, all bedecked and bedropped with strange
shiftings and flushes of prismatic light and shade, as if
they belonged to some fairy-land of perpetual festivity and
singing,&mdash;when Father Francesco stopped in his toilsome
ascent up the mountain, and seating himself on ropy ridges
of black lava, looked down on the peaceful landscape.</p>

<p>Above his head, behind him, rose the black cone of the
mountain, over whose top the lazy clouds of thin white
smoke were floating, tinged with the evening light; around
him, the desolate convulsed waste, so arid, so supernaturally
dreary; and below, like a soft enchanted dream, the
beautiful bay, the gleaming white villas and towers, the
picturesque islands, the gliding sails, flecked and streaked
and dyed with the violet and pink and purple of the evening
sky. The thin new moon and one glittering star trembled
through the rosy air.</p>

<p>The monk wiped from his brow the sweat that had
been caused by the toil of his hurried journey, and listened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
to the bells of the Ave Maria pealing from the different
churches of Naples, filling the atmosphere with a soft tremble
of solemn dropping sound, as if spirits in the air took
up and repeated over and over the angelic salutation which
a thousand earthly lips were just then uttering. Mechanically
he joined in the invocation which at that moment
united the hearts of all Christians, and as the words passed
his lips, he thought, with a sad, desolate longing, of the
hour of death of which they spake.</p>

<p>"It must come at last," he said. "Life is but a moment.
Why am I so cowardly? why so unwilling to suffer
and to struggle? Am I a warrior of the Lord, and do I
shrink from the toils of the camp, and long for the ease of
the court before I have earned it? Why do we clamor for
happiness? Why should we sinners be happy? And yet,
O God, why is the world made so lovely as it lies there,
why so rejoicing, and so girt with splendor and beauty, if
we are never to enjoy it? If penance and toil were all
we were sent here for, why not make a world grim and
desolate as this around me?&mdash;then there would be nothing
to seduce us. But our path is a constant fight; Nature is
made only to be resisted; we must walk the sharp blade of
the sword over the fiery chasm to Paradise. Come, then!&mdash;no
shrinking!&mdash;let me turn my back on everything dear
and beautiful, as now on this landscape!"</p>

<p>He rose and commenced the perpendicular ascent of the
cone, stumbling and climbing over the huge sliding blocks
of broken lava, which grated and crunched beneath his feet
with a harsh metallic ring. Sometimes a broken fragment
or two would go tinkling down the rough path behind him,
and sometimes it seemed as if the whole loose black mass
from above were about to slide, like an avalanche, down
upon his head;&mdash;he almost hoped it would. Sometimes
he would stop, overcome by the toil of the ascent, and seat
himself for a moment on a black fragment, and then his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
eye would wander over the wide and peaceful panorama
below. He seemed to himself like a fly perched upon
some little roughness of a perpendicular wall, and felt a
strange airy sense of pleasure in being thus between earth
and heaven. A sense of relief, of beauty, and peacefulness
would steal over him, as if he were indeed something disfranchised
and disembodied, a part of the harmonious and
beautiful world that lay stretched out beneath him; in a
moment more he would waken himself with a start, and
resume his toilsome journey with a sullen and dogged perseverance.</p>

<p>At last he gained the top of the mountain,&mdash;that weird,
strange region where the loose, hot soil, crumbling beneath
his feet, was no honest foodful mother-earth, but an acrid
mass of ashes and corrosive minerals. Arsenic, sulphur,
and many a sharp and bitter salt were in all he touched,
every rift in the ground hissed with stifling steam, while
rolling clouds of dun sullen smoke, and a deep hollow
booming, like the roar of an immense furnace, told his
nearness to the great crater. He penetrated the sombre
tabernacle, and stood on the very brink of a huge basin,
formed by a wall of rocks around a sunken plain, in the
midst of which rose the black cone of the subterraneous
furnace, which crackled and roared, and from time to time
spit up burning stones and cinders, or oozed out slow ropy
streams of liquid fire.</p>

<p>The sulphurous cliffs were dyed in many a brilliant
shade of brown and orange by the admixture of various
ores, but their brightness seemed strange and unnatural,
and the dizzying whirls of vapor, now enveloping the whole
scene in gloom, now lifting in this spot and now in that,
seemed to magnify the dismal pit to an indefinite size.
Now and then there would come up from the very entrails
of the mountain a sort of convulsed sob of hollow sound,
and the earth would quiver beneath his feet, and fragments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
from the surrounding rocks would scale off and fall with
crashing reverberations into the depth beneath; at such
moments it would seem as if the very mountain were about
to crush in and bear him down in its ruins.</p>

<p>Father Francesco, though blinded by the smoke and
choked by the vapor, could not be content without descending
into the abyss and exploring the very <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">penetralia</i> of its
mysteries. Steadying his way by means of a cord which
he fastened to a firm projecting rock, he began slowly and
painfully clambering downward. The wind was sweeping
across the chasm from behind, bearing the noxious vapors
away from him, or he must inevitably have been stifled.
It took him some little time, however, to effect his descent;
but at length he found himself fairly landed on the dark
floor of the gloomy enclosure.</p>

<p>The ropy, pitch-black undulations of lava yawned here
and there in red-hot cracks and seams, making it appear to
be only a crust over some fathomless depth of molten fire,
whose moanings and boilings could be heard below. These
dark congealed billows creaked and bent as the monk
stepped upon them, and burned his feet through his coarse
sandals; yet he stumbled on. Now and then his foot
would crush in, where the lava had hardened in a thinner
crust, and he would draw it suddenly back from the lurid
red-hot metal beneath. The staff on which he rested was
constantly kindling into a light blaze as it slipped into
some heated hollow, and he was fain to beat out the fire
upon the cooler surface. Still he went on half-stifled by
the hot and pungent vapor, but drawn by that painful,
unnatural curiosity which possesses one in a nightmare
dream. The great cone in the centre was the point to
which he wished to attain,&mdash;the nearest point which man
can gain to this eternal mystery of fire. It was trembling
with a perpetual vibration, a hollow, pulsating undertone
of sound like the surging of the sea before a storm, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
the lava that boiled over its sides rolled slowly down with
a strange creaking; it seemed the condensed, intensified
essence and expression of eternal fire, rising and still rising
from some inexhaustible fountain of burning.</p>

<p>Father Francesco drew as near as he could for the stifling
heat and vapor, and, resting on his staff, stood gazing intently.
The lurid light of the fire fell with an unearthly
glare on his pale, sunken features, his wild, haggard eyes,
and his torn and disarranged garments. In the awful solitude
and silence of the night he felt his heart stand still,
as if indeed he had touched with his very hand the gates
of eternal woe, and felt its fiery breath upon his cheek.
He half-imagined that the seams and clefts which glowed
in lurid lines between the dark billows would gape yet
wider and show the blasting secrets of some world of fiery
despair below. He fancied that he heard behind and
around the mocking laugh of fiends, and that confused
clamor of mingled shrieks and lamentations which Dante describes
as filling the dusky approaches to that forlorn realm
where hope never enters.</p>

<p>"Ah, God," he exclaimed, "for this vain life of man!
They eat, they drink, they dance, they sing, they marry
and are given in marriage, they have castles and gardens
and villas, and the very beauty of Paradise seems over it
all,&mdash;and yet how close by burns and roars the eternal
fire! Fools that we are, to clamor for indulgence and happiness
in this life, when the question is, to escape everlasting
burnings! If I tremble at this outer court of God's
wrath and justice, what must be the fires of hell? These
are but earthly fires; they can but burn the body: those
are made to burn the soul; they are undying as the soul
is. What would it be to be dragged down, down, down,
into an abyss of soul-fire hotter than this for ages on ages?
This might bring merciful death in time: that will have
no end."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
The monk fell on his knees and breathed out piercing
supplications. Every nerve and fibre within him seemed
tense with his agony of prayer. It was not the outcry
for purity and peace, not a tender longing for forgiveness,
not a filial remorse for sin, but the nervous anguish of
him who shrieks in the immediate apprehension of an unendurable
torture. It was the cry of a man upon the rack,
the despairing scream of him who feels himself sinking
in a burning dwelling. Such anguish has found an utterance
in Stradella's celebrated "Pietà, Signore," which still
tells to our ears, in its wild moans and piteous shrieks, the
religious conceptions of his day; for there is no phase
of the Italian mind that has not found expression in its
music.</p>

<p>When the oppression of the heat and sulphurous vapor
became too dreadful to be borne, the monk retraced his
way and climbed with difficulty up the steep sides of the
crater, till he gained the summit above, where a comparatively
free air revived him. All night he wandered up
and down in that dreary vicinity, now listening to the
mournful roar and crackle of the fire, and now raising his
voice in penitential psalms or the notes of that terrific
"Dies Iræ" which sums up all the intense fear and horror
with which the religion of the Middle Ages clothed the
idea of the final catastrophe of humanity. Sometimes
prostrating himself with his face towards the stifling soil,
he prayed with agonized intensity till Nature would sink
in a temporary collapse, and sleep, in spite of himself,
would steal over him.</p>

<p>So waned the gloomy hours of the night away, till the
morning broke in the east, turning all the blue wavering
floor of the sea to crimson brightness, and bringing up,
with the rising breeze, the barking of dogs, the lowing of
kine, the songs of laborers and boatmen, all fresh and
breezy from the repose of the past night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
Father Francesco heard the sound of approaching footsteps
climbing the lava path, and started with a nervous
trepidation. Soon he recognized a poor peasant of the
vicinity, whose child he had tended during a dangerous
illness. He bore with him a little basket of eggs, with a
melon and a fresh green salad.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, holy father," he said, bowing humbly.
"I saw you coming this way last night, and I could hardly
sleep for thinking of you; and my good woman, Teresina,
would have it that I should come out to look after you.
I have taken the liberty to bring a little offering;&mdash;it was
the best we had."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my son," said the monk, looking wistfully
at the fresh, honest face of the peasant. "You have taken
too much trouble for such a sinner. I must not allow
myself such indulgences."</p>

<p>"But your Reverence must live. Look you," said the
peasant, "at least your Reverence will take an egg. See
here, how handily I can cook one," he added, striking his
stick into a little cavity of a rock, from which, as from
an escape-valve, hissed a jet of hot steam,&mdash;"see here, I
nestle the egg in this little cleft, and it will be done in a
twinkling. Our good God gives us our fire for nothing
here."</p>

<p>There was something wholesomely kindly and cheerful
in the action and expression of the man, which broke upon
the overstrained and disturbed musings of the monk like
daylight on a ghastly dream. The honest, loving heart
sees love in everything; even the fire is its fatherly helper,
and not its avenging enemy.</p>

<p>Father Francesco took the egg, when it was done, with
a silent gesture of thanks.</p>

<p>"If I might make bold to say," said the peasant, encouraged,
"your Reverence should have some care for yourself.
If a man will not feed himself, the good God will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
not feed him; and we poor people have too few friends
already to let such as you die. Your hands are trembling,
and you look worn out. Surely you should take something
more, for the very love of the poor."</p>

<p>"My son, I am bound to do a heavy penance, and to
work out a great conflict. I thank you for your undeserved
kindness. Leave me now to myself, and come no more to
disturb my prayers. Go, and God bless you!"</p>

<p>"Well," said the peasant, putting down the basket and
melon, "I shall leave these things here, any way, and I
beg your Reverence to have a care of yourself. Teresina
fretted all night for fear something might come to you.
The <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">bambino</i> that you cured is grown a stout little fellow,
and eats enough for two,&mdash;and it is all of you; so she
cannot forget it. She is a busy little woman, is Teresina;
and when she gets a thought in her head, it buzzes, buzzes,
like a fly in a bottle, and she will have it your Reverence
is killing yourself by inches, and says she, 'What will all
the poor do when he is gone?' So your Reverence must
pardon us. We mean it all for the best."</p>

<p>So saying, the man turned and began sliding and slipping
down the steep ashy sides of the mountain cone with a dexterity
which carried him to the bottom in a few moments;
and on he went, sending back after him a cheerful little
air, the refrain of which is still to be heard in our days in
that neighborhood. A word or two of the gay song fluttered
back on the ear of the <span class="locked">monk,&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container" xml:lang="it" lang="it">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tutta gioja, tutta festa."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>So gay and airy it was in its ringing cadence that it seemed
a musical laugh springing from sunny skies, and came fluttering
into the dismal smoke and gloom of the mountaintop
like a very butterfly of sound. It struck on the sad,
leaden ear of the monk much as we might fancy the carol
of a robin over a grave might seem, could the cold sleeper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
below wake one moment to its perception. If it woke one
regretful sigh and drew one wandering look downward to
the elysian paradise that lay smiling at the foot of the
mountain, he instantly suppressed the feeling and set his
face in its old deathly stillness.</p>

<span class="smaller">CLOUDS DEEPENING</span></h2>

<p>After the departure of her uncle to Florence, the life of
Agnes was troubled and harassed from a variety of causes.</p>

<p>First, her grandmother was sulky and moody, and
though saying nothing directly on the topic nearest her
heart, yet intimating by every look and action that she
considered Agnes as a most ungrateful and contumacious
child. Then there was a constant internal perplexity,&mdash;a
constant wearying course of self-interrogation and self-distrust,
the pain of a sensitive spirit which doubts at
every moment whether it may not be falling into sin. The
absence of her kind uncle at this time took from her the
strongest support on which she had leaned in her perplexities.
Cheerful, airy, and elastic in his temperament, always
full of fresh-springing and beautiful thoughts, as an Italian
dell is of flowers, the charming old man seemed, while he
stayed with Agnes, to be the door of a new and fairer
world, where she could walk in air and sunshine, and find
utterance for a thousand thoughts and feelings which at all
other times lay in cold repression in her heart. His counsels
were always so wholesome, his sympathies so quick, his
devotion so fervent and cheerful, that while with him
Agnes felt the burden of her life insensibly lifted and carried
for her as by some angel guide.</p>

<p>Now they had all come back upon her, heavier a thousand-fold
than ever they had been before. Never did she
so much need counsel and guidance,&mdash;never had she so
much within herself to be solved and made plain to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
own comprehension; yet she thought with a strange shiver
of her next visit to her confessor. That austere man, so
chilling, so awful, so far above all conception of human
weaknesses, how should she dare to lay before him all the
secrets of her breast, especially when she must confess to
having disobeyed his most stringent commands? She had
had another interview with this forbidden son of perdition,
but how it was she knew not. How could such things
have happened? Instead of shutting her eyes and turning
her head and saying prayers, she had listened to a passionate
declaration of love, and his last word had called her his
wife. Her heart thrilled every time she thought of it;
and somehow she could not feel sure that it was exactly
a thrill of penitence. It was all like a strange dream to
her; and sometimes she looked at her little brown hands
and wondered if he really had kissed them,&mdash;he, the splendid
strange vision of a man, the prince from fairy-land!
Agnes had never read romances, it is true, but she had
been brought up on the legends of the saints, and there
never was a marvel possible to human conception that had
not been told there. Princes had come from China and
Barbary and Abyssinia and every other strange out-of-the-way
place, to kneel at the feet of fair, obdurate saints who
would not even turn the head to look at them; but she
had acted, she was conscious, after a much more mortal
fashion, and so made herself work for confession and penance.
Yet certainly she had not meant to do so; the interview
came on her so suddenly, so unexpectedly; and
somehow he <i>would</i> speak, and he would not go when she
asked him to; and she remembered how he looked when
he stood right before her in the door-way and told her she
<i>should</i> hear him,&mdash;how the color flushed up in his cheeks,
what a fire there was in his great dark eyes; he looked as
if he were going to do something desperate then; it made
her hold her breath even now to think of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
"These princes and nobles," she thought, "are so used
to command, it is no wonder they make us feel as if they
must have their will. I have heard grandmother call them
wolves and vultures, that are ready to tear us poor folk to
pieces; but I am sure he seems gentle. I'm sure it isn't
wicked or cruel for him to want to make me his wife; and
he couldn't know, of course, why it wasn't right he
should; and it really is beautiful of him to love me so.
Oh, if I were only a princess, and he loved me that way,
how glad I should be to give up everything and go to him
alone! And then we would pray together; and I really
think that would be much better than praying all alone.
He said men had so much more to tempt them. Ah, that
is true! How can little moles that grub in the ground
know of the dangers of eagles that fly to the very sun?
Holy Mother, look mercifully upon him and save his
soul!"</p>

<p>Such were the thoughts of Agnes the day when she was
preparing for her confession; and all the way to church
she found them floating and dissolving and reappearing in
new forms in her mind, like the silvery smoke-clouds which
were constantly veering and sailing over Vesuvius.</p>

<p>Only one thing was firm and never changing, and that
was the purpose to reveal everything to her spiritual director.
When she kneeled at the confessional with closed
eyes, and began her whispered acknowledgments, she tried
to feel as if she were speaking in the ear of God alone,&mdash;that
God whose spirit she was taught to believe, for the
time being, was present in His minister before whom her
inmost heart was to be unveiled.</p>

<p>He who sat within had just returned from his lonely
retreat with his mind and nerves in a state of unnatural
tension,&mdash;a sort of ecstatic clearness and calmness, which
he mistook for victory and peace. During those lonely
days when he had wandered afar from human converse, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
was surrounded only by objects of desolation and gloom,
he had passed through as many phases of strange, unnatural
experience as there were flitting smoke-wreaths eddying
about him.</p>

<p>There are depths in man's nature and his possibilities
which no plummet has ever sounded,&mdash;the wild, lonely
joys of fanatical excitement, the perfectly ravenous appetite
for self-torture, which seems able, in time, to reverse the
whole human system, and make a heaven of hell. How
else can we understand the facts related both in Hindoo
and in Christian story, of those men and women who have
found such strange raptures in slow tortures, prolonged
from year to year, till pain became a habit of body and
mind? It is said that after the tortures of the rack, the
reaction of the overstrained nerves produces a sense of the
most exquisite relief and repose; and so when mind and
body are harrowed, harassed to the very outer verge of endurance,
come wild throbbings and transports, and strange
celestial clairvoyance, which the mystic hails as the descent
of the New Jerusalem into his soul.</p>

<p>It had seemed to Father Francesco, when he came down
from the mountain, that he had left his body behind him,&mdash;that
he had left earth and earthly things; his very feet
touching the ground seemed to tread not on rough, resisting
soil, but on an elastic cloud. He saw a strange excess of
beauty in every flower, in every leaf, in the wavering blue
of the sea, in the red grottoed rocks that overhung the
shore, with their purple, green, orange, and yellow hangings
of flower-and-leaf tapestry. The songs of the fishermen
on the beach, the peasant-girls cutting flowery fodder
for the cattle, all seemed to him to have an unnatural
charm. As one looking through a prism sees a fine bordering
of rainbow on every object, so he beheld a glorified
world. His former self seemed to him something forever
past and gone. He looked at himself as at another person,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
who had sinned and suffered, and was now resting in beatified
repose; and he fondly thought all this was firm reality,
and believed that he was now proof against all earthly
impressions, able to hear and to judge with the dispassionate
calmness of a disembodied spirit. He did not know
that this high-strung calmness, this fine clearness, were
only the most intense forms of nervous sensibility, and as
vividly susceptible to every mortal impression as is the
vitalized chemical plate to the least action of the sun's
rays.</p>

<p>When Agnes began her confession, her voice seemed to
him to pass through every nerve; it seemed as if he could
feel her presence thrilling through the very wood of the
confessional. He was astonished and dismayed at his own
emotion. But when she began to speak of the interview
with the cavalier, he trembled from head to foot with
uncontrollable passion. Nature long repressed came back
in a tempestuous reaction. He crossed himself again and
again, he tried to pray, and blessed those protecting shadows
which concealed his emotion from the unconscious one by
his side. But he set his teeth in deadly resolve, and his
voice, as he questioned her, came forth cutting and cold as
ice crystals.</p>

<p>"Why did you listen to a word?"</p>

<p>"My father, it was so sudden. He wakened me from
sleep. I answered him before I thought."</p>

<p>"You should not have been sleeping. It was a sinful
indolence."</p>

<p>"Yes, my father."</p>

<p>"See now to what it led. The enemy of your soul, ever
watching, seized this moment to tempt you."</p>

<p>"Yes, my father."</p>

<p>"Examine your soul well," said Father Francesco, in a
tone of austere severity that made Agnes tremble. "Did
you not find a secret pleasure in his words?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
"My father, I fear I did," said she, with a trembling
voice.</p>

<p>"I knew it! I knew it!" the priest muttered to himself,
while the great drops started on his forehead, in the
intensity of the conflict he repressed. Agnes thought the
solemn pause that followed was caused by the horror that
had been inspired by her own sinfulness.</p>

<p>"You did not, then, heartily and truly wish him to go
from you?" pursued the cold, severe voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, my father, I did. I wished him to go with all
my soul."</p>

<p>"Yet you say you found pleasure in his being near you,"
said Father Francesco, conscious how every string of his
own being, even in this awful hour, was vibrating with a
sort of desperate, miserable joy in being once more near to
her.</p>

<p>"Ah," sighed Agnes, "that is true, my father,&mdash;woe is
me! Please tell me how I could have helped it. I was
pleased before I knew it."</p>

<p>"And you have been thinking of what he said to you
with pleasure since?" pursued the confessor, with an intense
severity of manner, deepening as he spoke.</p>

<p>"I <i>have</i> thought of it," faltered Agnes.</p>

<p>"Beware how you trifle with the holy sacrament! Answer
frankly. You have thought of it <i>with pleasure</i>.
Confess it."</p>

<p>"I do not understand myself exactly," said Agnes. "I
have thought of it partly with pleasure and partly with
pain."</p>

<p>"Would you like to go with him and be his wife, as he
said?"</p>

<p>"If it were right, father,&mdash;not otherwise."</p>

<p>"Oh, foolish child! oh, blinded soul! to think of right
in connection with an infidel and heretic! Do you not see
that all this is an artifice of Satan? He can transform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
himself into an angel of light. Do you suppose this heretic
would be brought back to the Church by a foolish girl?
Do you suppose it is your prayers he wants? Why does
he not seek the prayers of the Church,&mdash;of holy men who
have power with God? He would bait his hook with this
pretense that he may catch your soul. Do you believe
me?"</p>

<p>"I am bound to believe you, my father."</p>

<p>"But you do not. Your heart is going after this wicked
man."</p>

<p>"Oh, my father, I do not wish it should. I never wish
or expect to see him more. I only pray for him that his
soul may not be lost."</p>

<p>"He has gone, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my father. And he went with my uncle, a most
holy monk, who has undertaken the work of his salvation.
He listens to my uncle, who has hopes of restoring him to
the Church."</p>

<p>"That is well. And now, my daughter, listen to me.
You must root out of your thought every trace and remembrance
of these words of sinful earthly love which he hath
spoken. Such love would burn your soul to all eternity
with fire that never could be quenched. If you can tear
away all roots and traces of this from your heart, if by
fasting and prayer and penance you can become worthy to
be a bride of your divine Lord, then your prayers will gain
power, and you may prevail to secure his eternal salvation.
But listen to me, daughter,&mdash;listen and tremble! If ever
you should yield to his love and turn back from this heavenly
marriage to follow him, you will accomplish his damnation
and your own; to all eternity he will curse you,
while the fire rages and consumes him,&mdash;he will curse the
hour that he first saw you."</p>

<p>These words were spoken with an intense vehemence
which seemed almost supernatural. Agnes shivered and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
trembled; a vague feeling of guilt overwhelmed and disheartened
her; she seemed to herself the most lost and
abandoned of human beings.</p>

<p>"My father, I shall think no penance too severe that
may restore my soul from this sin. I have already made
a vow to the blessed Mother that I will walk on foot to
the Holy City, praying in every shrine and holy place;
and I humbly ask your approval."</p>

<p>This announcement brought to the mind of the monk a
sense of relief and deliverance. He felt already, in the
terrible storm of agitation which this confession had aroused
within him, that nature was not dead, and that he was infinitely
farther from the victory of passionless calm than he
had supposed. He was still a man,&mdash;torn with human
passions, with a love which he must never express, and a
jealousy which burned and writhed at every word which
he had wrung from its unconscious object. Conscience
had begun to whisper in his ear that there would be no
safety to him in continuing this spiritual dictatorship to
one whose every word unmanned him,&mdash;that it was laying
himself open to a ceaseless temptation, which in some
blinded, dreary hour of evil might hurry him into acts of
horrible sacrilege; and he was once more feeling that wild,
stormy revolt of his inner nature that so distressed him
before he left the convent.</p>

<p>This proposition of Agnes's struck him as a compromise.
It would take her from him only for a season, she would
go under his care and direction, and he would gradually
recover his calmness and self-possession in her absence.
Her pilgrimage to the holy places would be a most proper
and fit preparation for the solemn marriage-rite which
should forever sunder her from all human ties, and make
her inaccessible to all solicitations of human love. Therefore,
after an interval of silence, he <span class="locked">answered,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Daughter, your plan is approved. Such pilgrimages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
have ever been held meritorious works in the Church, and
there is a special blessing upon them."</p>

<p>"My father," said Agnes, "it has always been in my
heart from my childhood to be the bride of the Lord; but
my grandmother, who brought me up, and to whom I owe
the obedience of a daughter, utterly forbids me; she will
not hear a word of it. No longer ago than last Monday
she told me I might as well put a knife into her heart as
speak of this."</p>

<p>"And you, daughter, do you put the feelings of any
earthly friend before the love of your Lord and Creator
who laid down His life for you? Hear what He saith:
'He that loveth father or mother more than me is not
worthy of me.'"</p>

<p>"But my poor old grandmother has no one but me in
the world, and she has never slept a night without me;
she is getting old, and she has worked for me all her good
days;&mdash;it would be very hard for her to lose me."</p>

<p>"Ah, false, deceitful heart! Has, then, thy Lord not
labored for thee? Has He not borne thee through all the
years of thy life? And wilt thou put the love of any mortal
before His?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Agnes, with a sort of hardy sweetness,
"but my Lord does not need me as grandmother does;
He is in glory, and will never be old or feeble; I cannot
work for Him and tend Him as I shall her. I cannot see
my way clear at present; but when she is gone, or if the
saints move her to consent, I shall then belong to God
alone."</p>

<p>"Daughter, there is some truth in your words; and if
your Lord accepts you, He will dispose her heart. Will
she go with you on this pilgrimage?"</p>

<p>"I have prayed that she might, father,&mdash;that her soul
may be quickened; for I fear me, dear old grandmamma
has found her love for me a snare,&mdash;she has thought too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
much of my interests and too little of her own soul, poor
grandmamma!"</p>

<p>"Well, child, I shall enjoin this pilgrimage on her as a
penance."</p>

<p>"I have grievously offended her lately," said Agnes, "in
rejecting an offer of marriage with a man on whom she had
set her heart, and therefore she does not listen to me as
she is wont to do."</p>

<p>"You have done right in refusing, my daughter. I
will speak to her of this, and show her how great is the
sin of opposing a holy vocation in a soul whom the Lord
calls to Himself, and enjoin her to make reparation by
uniting with you in this holy work."</p>

<p>Agnes departed from the confessional without even looking
upon the face of her director, who sat within listening
to the rustle of her dress as she rose,&mdash;listening to the
soft fall of her departing footsteps, and praying that grace
might be given him not to look after her: and he did not,
though he felt as if his life were going with her.</p>

<p>Agnes tripped round the aisle to a little side-chapel
where a light was always kept burning by her before a
picture of Saint Agnes, and, kneeling there, waited till her
grandmother should be through with her confession.</p>

<p>"Ah, sweet Saint Agnes," she said, "pity me! I am
a poor ignorant young girl, and have been led into grievous
sin; but I did not mean to do wrong,&mdash;I have been trying
to do right; pray for me, that I may overcome as you
did. Pray our dear Lord to send you with us on this pilgrimage,
and save us from all wicked and brutal men who
would do us harm. As the Lord delivered you in sorest
straits, keeping soul and body pure as a lily, ah, pray Him
to keep me! I love you dearly,&mdash;watch over me and
guide me."</p>

<p>In those days of the Church, such addresses to the glorified
saints had become common among all Christians. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
were not regarded as worship, any more than a similar outpouring
of confidence to a beloved and revered friend yet
in the body. Among the hymns of Savonarola is one addressed
to Saint Mary Magdalen, whom he regarded with
an especial veneration. The great truth, that God is not
the God of the dead, but of the living, that <i>all</i> live to
Him, was in those ages with the truly religious a part of
spiritual consciousness. The saints of the Church Triumphant,
having become one with Christ as He is one with the
Father, were regarded as invested with a portion of his
divinity, and as the ministering agency through which his
mediatorial government on earth was conducted; and it
was thought to be in the power of the sympathetic heart
to attract them by the outflow of its affections, so that
their presence often overshadowed the walks of daily life
with a cloud of healing and protecting sweetness.</p>

<p>If the enthusiasm of devotion in regard to these invisible
friends became extravagant and took the language due
to God alone, it was no more than the fervid Italian nature
was always doing with regard to visible objects of affection.
Love with an Italian always tends to become worship, and
some of the language of the poets addressed to earthly loves
rises into intensities of expression due only to the One,
Sovereign, Eternal Beauty. One sees even in the writings
of Cicero that this passionate adoring kind of love is not
confined to modern times. When he loses the daughter in
whom his heart is garnered up, he finds no comfort except
in building a temple to her memory,&mdash;a blind outreaching
towards the saint-worship of modern times.</p>

<p>Agnes rose from her devotions, and went with downcast
eyes, her lips still repeating prayers, to the font of holy
water, which was in a dim shadowy corner, where a painted
window cast a gold and violet twilight. Suddenly there
was a rustle of garments in the dimness, and a jeweled
hand essayed to pass holy water to her on the tip of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
finger. This mark of Christian fraternity, common in those
times, Agnes almost mechanically accepted, touching her
slender finger to the one extended, and making the sign of
the cross, while she raised her eyes to see who stood there.
Gradually the haze cleared from her mind, and she awoke
to the consciousness that it was the cavalier! He moved
to come towards her, with a bright smile on his face; but
suddenly she became pale as one who has seen a spectre,
and, pushing from her with both hands, she said faintly,
"Go, go!" and turned and sped up the aisle silently as a
sunbeam, joining her grandmother, who was coming from
the confessional with a gloomy and sullen brow.</p>

<p>Old Elsie had been enjoined to unite with her grandchild
in this scheme of a pilgrimage, and received the direction
with as much internal contumacy as would a thriving
church-member of Wall Street a proposition to attend a
protracted meeting in the height of the business season.
Not but that pilgrimages were holy and gracious works,&mdash;she
was too good a Christian not to admit that,&mdash;but why
must holy and gracious works be thrust on her in particular?
There were saints enough who liked such things;
and people <i>could</i> get to heaven without,&mdash;if not with a
very abundant entrance, still in a modest way,&mdash;and Elsie's
ambition for position and treasure in the spiritual world was
of a very moderate cast.</p>

<p>"Well, now, I hope you are satisfied," she said to Agnes,
as she pulled her along with no very gentle hand;
"you've got me sent off on a pilgrimage,&mdash;and my old
bones must be rattling up and down all the hills between
here and Rome,&mdash;and who's to see to the oranges?&mdash;they'll
all be stolen, every one."</p>

<p>"Grandmother"&mdash;began Agnes in a pleading voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, you hush up! I know what you're going to say.
'The good Lord will take care of them.' I wish He may.
He has his hands full, with all the people that go cawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
and psalm-singing like so many crows, and leave all their
affairs to Him!"</p>

<p>Agnes walked along disconsolate, with her eyes full of
tears, which coursed one another down her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>"There's Antonio," pursued Elsie, "would perhaps look
after things a little. He is a good fellow, and only yesterday
was asking if he couldn't do something for us. It's
you he does it for,&mdash;but little you care who loves you, or
what they do for you!"</p>

<p>At this moment they met old Jocunda, whom we have
before introduced to the reader as portress of the Convent.
She had on her arm a large square basket, which she was
storing for its practical uses.</p>

<p>"Well, well, Saint Agnes be praised, I have found you
at last," she said. "I was wanting to speak about some
of your blood-oranges for conserving. An order has come
down from our dear gracious lady, the Queen, to prepare a
lot for her own blessed eating, and you may be sure I
would get none of anybody but you. But what's this, my
little heart, my little lamb?&mdash;crying?&mdash;tears in those
sweet eyes? What's the matter now?"</p>

<p>"Matter enough for me!" said Elsie. "It's a weary
world we live in. A body can't turn any way and not
meet with trouble. If a body brings up a girl one way,
why, every fellow is after her, and one has no peace; and
if a body brings her up another way, she gets her head in
the clouds, and there's no good of her in this world. Now
look at that girl,&mdash;doesn't everybody say it's time she
were married?&mdash;but no marrying for her! Nothing will
do but we must off to Rome on a pilgrimage,&mdash;and what's
the good of that, I want to know? If it's praying that's
to be done, the dear saints know she's at it from morning
till night,&mdash;and lately she's up and down three or four
times a night with some prayer or other."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Jocunda, "who started this idea?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
"Oh, Father Francesco and she got it up between them,
and nothing will do but I must go, too."</p>

<p>"Well, now, after all, my dear," said Jocunda, "do you
know, I made a pilgrimage once, and it isn't so bad. One
gets a good deal by it, first and last. Everybody drops
something into your hand as you go, and one gets treated
as if one were somebody a little above the common; and
then in Rome one has a princess or a duchess or some noble
lady who washes one's feet, and gives one a good supper,
and perhaps a new suit of clothes, and all that,&mdash;and ten
to one there comes a pretty little sum of money to boot, if
one plays one's cards well. A pilgrimage isn't bad, after
all; one sees a world of fine things, and something new
every day."</p>

<p>"But who is to look after our garden and dress our
trees?"</p>

<p>"Ah, now, there's Antonio, and old Meta his mother,"
said Jocunda, with a knowing wink at Agnes. "I fancy
there are friends there that would lend a hand to keep
things together against the little one comes home. If one
is going to be married, a pilgrimage brings good luck in
the family. All the saints take it kindly that one comes
so far to see them, and are more ready to do a good turn
for one when one needs it. The blessed saints are like
other folks, they like to be treated with proper attention."</p>

<p>This view of pilgrimages from the material standpoint
had more effect on the mind of Elsie than the most elaborate
appeals of Father Francesco. She began to acquiesce,
though with a reluctant air.</p>

<p>Jocunda, seeing her words had made some impression,
pursued her advantage on the spiritual ground.</p>

<p>"To be sure," she added, "I don't know how it is with
you; but I know that <i>I</i> have, one way and another, rolled
up quite an account of sins in my life. When I was
tramping up and down with my old man through the country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>&mdash;now
in this castle and then in that camp, and now
and then in at the sacking of a city or village, or something
of the kind,&mdash;the saints forgive us!&mdash;it does seem as if
one got into things that were not of the best sort, in such
times. It's true, it's been wiped out over and over by the
priest; but then a pilgrimage is a good thing to make all
sure, in case one's good works should fall short of one's sins
at last. I can tell you, a pilgrimage is a good round weight
to throw into the scale; and when it comes to heaven and
hell, you know, my dear, why, one cannot be too careful."</p>

<p>"Well, that may be true enough," said Elsie, "though
as to my sins, I have tried to keep them regularly squared
up and balanced as I went along. I have always been
regular at confession, and never failed a jot or tittle in
what the holy father told me. But there may be something
in what you say; one can't be too sure; and so I'll
e'en school my old bones into taking this tramp."</p>

<p>That evening, as Agnes was sitting in the garden at
sunset, her grandmother bustling in and out, talking,
groaning, and hurrying in her preparations for the anticipated
undertaking, suddenly there was a rustling in the
branches overhead, and a bouquet of rosebuds fell at her
feet. Agnes picked it up, and saw a scrip of paper coiled
among the flowers. In a moment, remembering the apparition
of the cavalier in the church in the morning, she
doubted not from whom it came. So dreadful had been
the effect of the scene at the confessional, that the thought
of the near presence of her lover brought only terror. She
turned pale; her hands shook. She shut her eyes, and
prayed that she might not be left to read the paper; and
then, summoning all her resolution, she threw the bouquet
with force over the wall. It dropped down, down, down
the gloomy, shadowy abyss, and was lost in the damp caverns
below.</p>

<p>The cavalier stood without the wall, waiting for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
responsive signal in reply to his missive. It had never
occurred to him that Agnes would not even read it, and
he stood confounded when he saw it thrown back with
such apparent rudeness. He remembered her pale, terrified
look on seeing him in the morning. It was not indifference
or dislike, but mortal fear, that had been shown in
that pale face.</p>

<p>"These wretches are practicing on her," he said, in
wrath, "filling her head with frightful images, and torturing
her sensitive conscience till she sees sin in the most
natural and innocent feelings."</p>

<p>He had learned from Father Antonio the intention of
Agnes to go on a pilgrimage, and he longed to see and talk
with her, that he might offer her his protection against
dangers which he understood far better than she. It had
never even occurred to him that the door for all possible
communication would be thus suddenly barred in his face.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said to himself, with a darkening brow,
"let them have it their own way here. She must pass
through my dominions before she can reach Rome, and I
will find a place where I <i>can</i> be heard, without priest or
grandmother to let or hinder. She is mine, and I will
care for her."</p>

<p>But poor Agnes had the woman's share of the misery to
bear, in the fear and self-reproach and distress which every
movement of this kind cost her. The involuntary thrill at
seeing her lover, at hearing from him, the conscious struggle
which it cost her to throw back his gift, were all noted
by her accusing conscience as so many sins. The next
day she sought again her confessor, and began an entrance
on those darker and more chilly paths of penance, by which,
according to the opinion of her times, the peculiarly elect
of the Lord were supposed to be best trained. Hitherto
her religion had been the cheerful and natural expression
of her tender and devout nature, according to the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
beautiful and engaging devotional forms of her Church.
During the year when her confessor had been, unconsciously
to himself, led by her instead of leading, her spiritual food
had been its beautiful old hymns and prayers, which she
found no weariness in often repeating. But now an unnatural
conflict was begun in her mind, directed by a spiritual
guide in whom every natural and normal movement
of the soul had given way before a succession of morbid
and unhealthful experiences. From that day Agnes wore
upon her heart one of those sharp instruments of torture
which in those items were supposed to be a means of inward
grace,&mdash;a cross with seven steel points for the seven
sorrows of Mary. She fasted with a severity which alarmed
her grandmother, who in her inmost heart cursed the day
that ever she had placed her in the way of saintship.</p>

<p>"All this will just end in spoiling her beauty,&mdash;making
her as thin as a shadow," said Elsie; "and she was good
enough before."</p>

<p>But it did not spoil her beauty, it only changed its
character. The roundness and bloom melted away, but
there came in their stead that solemn, transparent clearness
of countenance, that spiritual light and radiance, which the
old Florentine painters gave to their Madonnas.</p>

<p>It is singular how all religious exercises and appliances
take the character of the nature that uses them. The pain
and penance, which so many in her day bore as a cowardly
expedient for averting divine wrath, seemed, as she viewed
them, a humble way of becoming associated in the sufferings
of her Redeemer. "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Jesu dulcis memoria</i>," was the
thought that carried a redeeming sweetness with every
pain. Could she thus, by suffering with her Lord, gain
power like Him to save,&mdash;a power which should save that
soul so dear and so endangered! "Ah," she thought, "I
would give my life-blood, drop by drop, if only it might
avail for his salvation!"</p>

<span class="smaller">FLORENCE AND HER PROPHET</span></h2>

<p>It was drawing towards evening, as two travelers, approaching
Florence from the south, checked their course on
the summit of one of the circle of hills which command a
view of the city, and seemed to look down upon it with
admiration. One of these was our old friend Father Antonio,
and the other the cavalier. The former was mounted
on an ambling mule, whose easy pace suited well with his
meditative habits; while the other reined in a high-mettled
steed, who, though now somewhat jaded under the fatigue
of a long journey, showed by a series of little lively motions
of his ears and tail, and by pawing the ground impatiently,
that he had the inexhaustible stock of spirits which goes
with good blood.</p>

<p>"There she lies, my Florence," said the monk, stretching
his hands out with enthusiasm. "Is she not indeed a
sheltered lily growing fair among the hollows of the mountains?
Little she may be, sir, compared to old Rome; but
every inch of her is a gem,&mdash;every inch!"</p>

<p>And, in truth, the scene was worthy of the artist's enthusiasm.
All the overhanging hills that encircle the city
with their silvery olive-gardens and their pearl-white villas
were now lighted up with evening glory. The old gray
walls of the convents of San Miniato and the Monte Oliveto
were touched with yellow; and even the black obelisks of
the cypresses in their cemeteries had here and there streaks
and dots of gold, fluttering like bright birds among their
gloomy branches. The distant snow-peaks of the Apennines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
which even in spring long wear their icy mantles,
were shimmering and changing like an opal ring with tints
of violet, green, blue, and rose, blended in inexpressible
softness by that dreamy haze which forms the peculiar
feature of Italian skies.</p>

<p>In this loving embrace of mountains lay the city, divided
by the Arno as by a line of rosy crystal barred by the graceful
arches of its bridges. Amid the crowd of palaces and
spires and towers rose central and conspicuous the great
Duomo, just crowned with that magnificent dome which
was then considered a novelty and a marvel in architecture,
and which Michel Angelo looked longingly back upon when
he was going to Rome to build that more wondrous orb of
Saint Peter's. White and stately by its side shot up the
airy shaft of the Campanile; and the violet vapor swathing
the whole city in a tender indistinctness, these two striking
objects, rising by their magnitude far above it, seemed
to stand alone in a sort of airy grandeur.</p>

<p>And now the bells of the churches were sounding the
Ave Maria, filling the air with sweet and solemn vibrations,
as if angels were passing to and fro overhead, harping
as they went; and ever and anon the great bell of the
Campanile came pulsing in with a throb of sound of a quality
so different that one hushed one's breath to hear. It
might be fancied to be the voice of one of those kingly
archangels that one sees drawn by the old Florentine
religious artists,&mdash;a voice grave and unearthly, and with a
plaintive undertone of divine mystery.</p>

<p>The monk and the cavalier bent low in their saddles,
and seemed to join devoutly in the worship of the hour.</p>

<p>One need not wonder at the enthusiasm of the returning
pilgrim of those days for the city of his love, who feels the
charm that lingers around that beautiful place even in
modern times. Never was there a spot to which the heart
could insensibly grow with a more home-like affection,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>never
one more thoroughly consecrated in every stone by
the sacred touch of genius.</p>

<p>A republic, in the midst of contending elements, the
history of Florence, in the Middle Ages, was a history of
what shoots and blossoms the Italian nature might send
forth, when rooted in the rich soil of liberty. It was a
city of poets and artists. Its statesmen, its merchants, its
common artisans, and the very monks in its convents, were
all pervaded by one spirit. The men of Florence in its
best days were men of a large, grave, earnest mould.
What the Puritans of New England wrought out with severest
earnestness in their reasonings and their lives, these
early Puritans of Italy embodied in poetry, sculpture, and
painting. They built their Cathedral and their Campanile,
as the Jews of old built their Temple, with awe and religious
fear, that they might thus express by costly and imperishable
monuments their sense of God's majesty and
beauty. The modern traveler who visits the churches and
convents of Florence, or the museums where are preserved
the fading remains of its early religious Art, if he be a
person of any sensibility, cannot fail to be affected with
the intense gravity and earnestness which pervade them.
They seem less to be paintings for the embellishment of
life than eloquent picture-writing by which burning religious
souls sought to preach the truths of the invisible
world to the eye of the multitude. Through all the deficiencies
of perspective, coloring, and outline incident to
the childhood and early youth of Art, one feels the passionate
purpose of some lofty soul to express ideas of patience,
self-sacrifice, adoration, and aspiration far transcending
the limits of mortal capability.</p>

<p>The angels and celestial beings of these grave old
painters are as different from the fat little pink Cupids or
lovely laughing children of Titian and Correggio as are the
sermons of President Edwards from the love-songs of Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
Moore. These old seers of the pencil give you grave, radiant
beings, strong as man, fine as woman, sweeping downward
in lines of floating undulation, and seeming by the
ease with which they remain poised in the air to feel none
of that earthly attraction which draws material bodies earthward.
Whether they wear the morning star on their forehead
or bear the lily or the sword in their hand, there is
still that suggestion of mystery and power about them, that
air of dignity and repose, that speak the children of a nobler
race than ours. One could well believe such a being
might pass in his serene poised majesty of motion through
the walls of a gross material dwelling without deranging
one graceful fold of his swaying robe or unclasping the
hands folded quietly on his bosom. Well has a modern
master of art and style said of these old artists, "Many
pictures are ostentatious exhibitions of the artist's power of
speech, the clear and vigorous elocution of useless and
senseless words; while the earlier efforts of Giotto and
Cimabue are the burning messages of prophecy delivered by
the stammering lips of infants."</p>

<p>But at the time of which we write, Florence had passed
through her ages of primitive religious and republican simplicity,
and was fast hastening to her downfall. The genius,
energy, and prophetic enthusiasm of Savonarola had made,
it is true, a desperate rally on the verge of the precipice;
but no one man has ever power to turn back the downward
slide of a whole generation.</p>

<p>When Father Antonio left Sorrento in company with
the cavalier, it was the intention of the latter to go with
him only so far as their respective routes should lie together.
The band under the command of Agostino was
posted in a ruined fortress in one of those airily perched
old mountain-towns which form so picturesque and characteristic
a feature of the Italian landscape. But before they
reached this spot, the simple, poetic, guileless monk, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
his fresh artistic nature, had so won upon his traveling
companion that a most enthusiastic friendship had sprung
up between them, and Agostino could not find it in his
heart at once to separate from him. Tempest-tossed and
homeless, burning with a sense of wrong, alienated from
the faith of his fathers through his intellect and moral
sense, yet clinging to it with his memory and imagination,
he found in the tender devotional fervor of the artist monk
a reconciling and healing power. He shared, too, in no
small degree, the feelings which now possessed the breast
of his companion for the great reformer whose purpose
seemed to meditate nothing less than the restoration of the
Church of Italy to the primitive apostolic simplicity. He
longed to see him,&mdash;to listen to the eloquence of which
he had heard so much. Then, too, he had thoughts that
but vaguely shaped themselves in his mind. This noble
man, so brave and courageous, menaced by the forces of a
cruel tyranny, might he not need the protection of a good
sword? He recollected, too, that he had an uncle high in
the favor of the King of France, to whom he had written
a full account of his own situation. Might he not be of
use in urging this uncle to induce the French King to
throw before Savonarola the shield of his protection? At
all events, he entered Florence this evening with the burning
zeal of a young neophyte who hopes to effect something
himself for a glorious and sacred cause embodied in a leader
who commands his deepest veneration.</p>

<p>"My son," said Father Antonio, as they raised their
heads after the evening prayer, "I am at this time like a
man who, having long been away from his home, fears, on
returning, that he shall hear some evil tidings of those he
hath left. I long, yet dread, to go to my dear Father
Girolamo and the beloved brothers in our house. There
is a presage that lies heavy on my heart, so that I cannot
shake it off. Look at our glorious old Duomo;&mdash;doth she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
not sit there among the houses and palaces as a queen-mother
among nations,&mdash;worthy, in her greatness and
beauty, to represent the Church of the New Jerusalem, the
Bride of the Lord? Ah, I have seen it thronged and
pressed with the multitude who came to crave the bread of
life from our master!"</p>

<p>"Courage, my friend!" said Agostino; "it cannot be
that Florence will suffer her pride and glory to be trodden
down. Let us hasten on, for the shades of evening are
coming fast, and there is a keen wind sweeping down from
your snowy mountains." And the two soon found themselves
plunging into the shadows of the streets, threading
their devious way to the convent.</p>

<p>At length they drew up before a dark wall, where the
Father Antonio rung a bell.</p>

<p>A door was immediately opened, a cowled head appeared,
and a cautious voice <span class="locked">asked,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Who is there?"</p>

<p>"Ah, is that you, good Brother Angelo?" said Father
Antonio, cheerily.</p>

<p>"And is it you, dear Brother Antonio? Come in! come
in!" was the cordial response, as the two passed into the
court; "truly, it will make all our hearts leap to see you."</p>

<p>"And, Brother Angelo, how is our dear father? I have
been so anxious about him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, fear not!&mdash;he sustains himself in God, and is full
of sweetness to us all."</p>

<p>"But do the people stand by him, Angelo, and the
Signoria?"</p>

<p>"He has strong friends as yet, but his enemies are like
ravening wolves. The Pope hath set on the Franciscans,
and they hunt him as dogs do a good stag. But whom
have you here with you?" added the monk, raising his
torch and regarding the knight.</p>

<p>"Fear him not; he is a brave knight and good Christian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
who comes to offer his sword to our father and seek his
counsels."</p>

<p>"He shall be welcome," said the porter, cheerfully.
"We will have you into the refectory forthwith, for you
must be hungry."</p>

<p>The young cavalier, following the flickering torch of his
conductor, had only a dim notion of long cloistered corridors,
out of which now and then, as the light flared by,
came a golden gleam from some quaint old painting, where
the pure angel forms of Angelico stood in the gravity of
an immortal youth, or the Madonna, like a bending lily,
awaited the message of Heaven; but when they entered
the refectory, a cheerful voice addressed them, and Father
Antonio was clasped in the embrace of the father so much
beloved.</p>

<p>"Welcome, welcome, my dear son!" said that rich voice
which had thrilled so many thousand Italian hearts with
its music. "So you are come back to the fold again.
How goes the good work of the Lord?"</p>

<p>"Well, everywhere," said Father Antonio, and then, recollecting
his young friend, he suddenly turned and <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Let me present to you one son who comes to seek your
instructions,&mdash;the young Signor Agostino, of the noble
house of Sarelli."</p>

<p>The Superior turned to Agostino with a movement full
of a generous frankness, and warmly extended his hand,
at the same time fixing upon him the mesmeric glance of
a pair of large, deep blue eyes, which might, on slight observation,
have been mistaken for black, so great was their
depth and brilliancy.</p>

<p>Agostino surveyed his new acquaintance with that mingling
of ingenuous respect and curiosity with which an ardent
young man would regard the most distinguished leader
of his age, and felt drawn to him by a certain atmosphere
of vital cordiality such as one can feel better than describe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
"You have ridden far to-day, my son,&mdash;you must be
weary," said the Superior, affably; "but here you must
feel yourself at home; command us in anything we can do
for you. The brothers will attend to those refreshments
which are needed after so long a journey; and when you
have rested and supped, we shall hope to see you a little
more quietly."</p>

<p>So saying, he signed to one or two brothers who stood
by, and, commending the travelers to their care, left the
apartment.</p>

<p>In a few moments a table was spread with a plain and
wholesome repast, to which the two travelers sat down
with appetites sharpened by their long journey.</p>

<p>During the supper, the brothers of the convent, among
whom Father Antonio had always been a favorite, crowded
around him in a state of eager excitement.</p>

<p>"You should have been here the last week," said one;
"such a turmoil as we have been in!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said another, "the Pope hath set on the Franciscans,
who, you know, are always ready enough to take
up with anything against our order, and they have been
pursuing our father like so many hounds."</p>

<p>"There hath been a whirlwind of preaching here and
there," said a third, "in the Duomo, and Santa Croce, and
San Lorenzo; and they have battled to and fro, and all
the city is full of it."</p>

<p>"Tell him about yesterday, about the ordeal," shouted
an eager voice.</p>

<p>Two or three voices took up the story at once, and
began to tell it, all the others correcting, contradicting, or
adding incidents. From the confused fragments here and
there Agostino gathered that there had been on the day
before a popular spectacle in the grand piazza, in which,
according to an old superstition of the Middle Ages, Fra
Girolamo Savonarola and his opponents were expected to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
prove the truth of their words by passing unhurt through
the fire; that two immense piles of combustibles had been
constructed with a narrow passage between, and the whole
magistracy of the city convened, with a throng of the populace,
eager for the excitement of the spectacle; that the
day had been spent in discussions, and scruples, and preliminaries;
and that, finally, in the afternoon, a violent
storm of rain arising had dispersed the multitude and put
a stop to the whole exhibition.</p>

<p>"But the people are not satisfied," said Father Angelo;
"and there are enough mischief-makers among them to
throw all the blame on our father."</p>

<p>"Yes," said one, "they say he wanted to burn the Holy
Sacrament, because he was going to take it with him into
the fire."</p>

<p>"As if it could burn!" said another voice.</p>

<p>"It would to all human appearance, I suppose," said a
third.</p>

<p>"Any way," said a fourth, "there is some mischief
brewing; for here is our friend Prospero Rondinelli just
come in, who says, when he came past the Duomo, he saw
people gathering, and heard them threatening us: there
were as many as two hundred, he thought."</p>

<p>"We ought to tell Father Girolamo," exclaimed several
voices.</p>

<p>"Oh, he will not be disturbed!" said Father Angelo.
Since these affairs, he hath been in prayer in the chapter-room
before the blessed Angelico's picture of the Cross.
When we would talk with him of these things, he waves
us away, and says only, 'I am weary; go and tell Jesus.'"</p>

<p>"He bade me come to him after supper," said Father
Antonio. "I will talk with him."</p>

<p>"Do so,&mdash;that is right," said two or three eager voices
as the monk and Agostino, having finished their repast,
arose to be conducted to the presence of the father.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ATTACK ON SAN MARCO</span></h2>

<p>They found him in a large and dimly lighted apartment,
sitting absorbed in pensive contemplation before a picture
of the Crucifixion by Fra Angelico, which, whatever might
be its <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">naïve</i> faults of drawing and perspective, had an intense
earnestness of feeling, and, though faded and dimmed
by the lapse of centuries, still stirs in some faint wise even
the practiced <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">dilettanti</i> of our day.</p>

<p>The face upon the cross, with its majestic patience,
seemed to shed a blessing down on the company of saints
of all ages who were grouped by their representative men
at the foot. Saint Dominic, Saint Ambrose, Saint Augustin,
Saint Jerome, Saint Francis, and Saint Benedict were
depicted as standing before the Great Sacrifice in company
with the Twelve Apostles, the two Maries, and the fainting
mother of Jesus,&mdash;thus expressing the unity of the
Church Universal in that great victory of sorrow and glory.
The painting was enclosed above by a semicircular bordering
composed of medallion heads of the Prophets, and below
was a similar medallion border of the principal saints
and worthies of the Dominican order. In our day such
pictures are visited by tourists with red guide-books in
their hands, who survey them in the intervals of careless
conversation; but they were painted by the simple artist
on his knees, weeping and praying as he worked, and the
sight of them was accepted by like simple-hearted Christians
as a perpetual sacrament of the eye, by which they
received Christ into their souls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
So absorbed was the father in the contemplation of this
picture, that he did not hear the approaching footsteps of
the knight and monk. When at last they came so near as
almost to touch him, he suddenly looked up, and it became
apparent that his eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>He rose, and, pointing with a mute gesture toward the
painting, <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"There is more in that than in all Michel Angelo Buonarotti
hath done yet, though he be a God-fearing youth,&mdash;more
than in all the heathen marbles in Lorenzo's gardens.
But sit down with me here. I have to come here often,
where I can refresh my courage."</p>

<p>The monk and knight seated themselves, the latter with
his attention riveted on the remarkable man before him.
The head and face of Savonarola are familiar to us by many
paintings and medallions, which, however, fail to impart
what must have been that effect of his personal presence
which so drew all hearts to him in his day. The knight
saw a man of middle age, of elastic, well-knit figure, and
a flexibility and grace of motion which seemed to make
every nerve, even to his finger-ends, vital with the expression
of his soul. The close-shaven crown and the plain
white Dominican robe gave a severe and statuesque simplicity
to the lines of his figure. His head and face, like those
of most of the men of genius whom modern Italy has produced,
were so strongly cast in the antique mould as to
leave no doubt of the identity of modern Italian blood with
that of the great men of ancient Italy. His low, broad
forehead, prominent Roman nose, well-cut, yet fully outlined
lips, and strong, finely moulded jaw and chin, all
spoke the old Roman vigor and energy, while the flexible
delicacy of all the muscles of his face and figure gave an
inexpressible fascination to his appearance. Every emotion
and changing thought seemed to flutter and tremble over
his countenance as the shadow of leaves over sunny water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
His eye had a wonderful dilating power, and when he was
excited seemed to shower sparks; and his voice possessed
a surprising scale of delicate and melodious inflections,
which could take him in a moment through the whole
range of human feeling, whether playful and tender or denunciatory
and terrible. Yet, when in repose among his
friends, there was an almost childlike simplicity and artlessness
of manner which drew the heart by an irresistible
attraction. At this moment it was easy to see by his pale
cheek and the furrowed lines of his face that he had been
passing through severe struggles; but his mind seemed
stayed on some invisible centre, in a solemn and mournful
calm.</p>

<p>"Come, tell me something of the good works of the
Lord in our Italy, brother," he said, with a smile which
was almost playful in its brightness. "You have been
through all the lowly places of the land, carrying our
Lord's bread to the poor, and repairing and beautifying
shrines and altars by the noble gift that is in you."</p>

<p>"Yes, father," said the monk; "and I have found that
there are many sheep of the Lord that feed quietly among
the mountains of Italy, and love nothing so much as to hear
of the dear Shepherd who laid down His life for them."</p>

<p>"Even so, even so," said the Superior, with animation;
"and it is the thought of these sweet hearts that comforts
me when my soul is among lions. The foundation standeth
sure,&mdash;the Lord knoweth them that are his."</p>

<p>"And it is good and encouraging," said Father Antonio,
"to see the zeal of the poor, who will give their last penny
for the altar of the Lord, and who flock so to hear the
word and take the sacraments. I have had precious seasons
of preaching and confessing, and have worked in
blessedness many days restoring and beautifying the holy
pictures and statues whereby these little ones have been
comforted. What with the wranglings of princes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
the factions and disturbances in our poor Italy, there be
many who suffer in want and loss of all things, so that no
refuge remains to them but the altars of our Jesus, and
none cares for them but He."</p>

<p>"Brother," said the Superior, "there be thousands of
flowers fairer than man ever saw that grow up in waste
places and in deep dells and shades of mountains; but God
bears each one in his heart, and delighteth Himself in
silence with them: and so doth He with these poor, simple,
unknown souls. The True Church is not a flaunting
queen who goes boldly forth among men displaying her
beauties, but a veiled bride, a dove that is in the cleft of
the rocks, whose voice is known only to the Beloved.
Ah! when shall the great marriage-feast come, when all
shall behold her glorified? I had hoped to see the day
here in Italy: but <span class="locked">now"&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The father stopped, and seemed to lapse into unconscious
musing,&mdash;his large eye growing fixed and mysterious in
its expression.</p>

<p>"The brothers have been telling me somewhat of the
tribulations you have been through," said Father Antonio,
who thought he saw a good opening to introduce the subject
nearest his heart.</p>

<p>"No more of that!&mdash;no more!" said the Superior,
turning away his head with an expression of pain and
weariness, "rather let us look up. What think you, brother,
are all <i>these</i> doing now?" he said, pointing to the
saints in the picture. "They are all alive and well, and
see clearly through our darkness." Then, rising up, he
added, solemnly, "Whatever man may say or do, it is
enough for me to feel that my dearest Lord and his blessed
Mother and all the holy archangels, the martyrs and prophets
and apostles, are with me. The end is coming."</p>

<p>"But, dearest father," said Antonio, "think you the
Lord will suffer the wicked to prevail?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
"It may be for a time," said Savonarola. "As for me,
I am in His hands only as an instrument. He is master
of the forge and handles the hammer, and when He has
done using it He casts it from Him. Thus He did with
Jeremiah, whom He permitted to be stoned to death when
his preaching mission was accomplished; and thus He may
do with <i>this</i> hammer when He has done using it."</p>

<p>At this moment a monk rushed into the room with a
face expressive of the utmost terror, and called <span class="locked">out,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Father, what shall we do? The mob are surrounding
the convent! Hark! hear them at the doors!"</p>

<p>In truth, a wild, confused roar of mingled shrieks,
cries, and blows came in through the open door of the
apartment; and the pattering sound of approaching footsteps
was heard like showering rain-drops along the cloisters.</p>

<p>"Here come Messer Nicolo de' Lapi, and Francesco
Valori!" called out a voice.</p>

<p>The room was soon filled with a confused crowd, consisting
of distinguished Florentine citizens, who had gained
admittance through a secret passage, and the excited novices
and monks.</p>

<p>"The streets outside the convent are packed close with
men," cried one of the citizens; "they have stationed
guards everywhere to cut off our friends who might come
to help us."</p>

<p>"I saw them seize a young man who was quietly walking,
singing psalms, and slay him on the steps of the
Church of the Innocents," said another; "they cried and
hooted, 'No more psalm-singing!'"</p>

<p>"And there's Arnolfo Battista," said a third;&mdash;"he
went out to try to speak to them, and they have killed
him,&mdash;cut him down with their sabres."</p>

<p>"Hurry! hurry! barricade the door! arm yourselves!"
was the cry from other voices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
"Shall we fight, father? Shall we defend ourselves?"
cried others, as the monks pressed around their Superior.</p>

<p>When the crowd first burst into the room, the face of
the Superior flushed, and there was a slight movement of
surprise; then he seemed to recollect himself, and murmuring,
"I expected this, but not so soon," appeared lost in
mental prayer. To the agitated inquiries of his flock, he
answered, "No, brothers; the weapons of monks must be
spiritual, not carnal." Then lifting on high a crucifix,
he said, "Come with me, and let us walk in solemn procession
to the altar, singing the praises of our God."</p>

<p>The monks, with the instinctive habit of obedience, fell
into procession behind their leader, whose voice, clear and
strong, was heard raising the Psalm, "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quare fremunt
gentes</i><span class="locked">:"&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a
vain thing?</p>

<p>"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers
take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his
Anointed, <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their
cords from us.</p>

<p>"He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord
shall have them in derision."</p>

<p>As one voice after another took up the chant, the solemn
enthusiasm rose and deepened, and all present, whether
ecclesiastics or laymen, fell into the procession and joined
in the anthem. Amid the wild uproar, the din and clatter
of axes, the thunders of heavy battering-implements on the
stone walls and portals, came this long-drawn solemn wave
of sound, rising and falling,&mdash;now drowned in the savage
clamors of the mob, and now bursting out clear and full
like the voices of God's chosen amid the confusion and
struggles of all the generations of this mortal life.</p>

<p>White-robed and grand the procession moved on, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
the pictured saints and angels on the walls seemed to smile
calmly down upon them from a golden twilight. They
passed thus into the sacristy, where with all solemnity and
composure they arrayed their Father and Superior for the
last time in his sacramental robes, and then, still chanting,
followed him to the high altar, where all bowed in prayer.
And still, whenever there was a pause in the stormy uproar
and fiendish clamor, might be heard the clear, plaintive
uprising of that strange singing, "O Lord, save thy people,
and bless thine heritage!"</p>

<p>It needs not to tell in detail what history has told of
that tragic night: how the doors at last were forced, and
the mob rushed in; how citizens and friends, and many of
the monks themselves, their instinct of combativeness overcoming
their spiritual beliefs, fought valiantly, and used
torches and crucifixes for purposes little contemplated when
they were made.</p>

<p>Fiercest among the combatants was Agostino, who three
times drove back the crowd as they were approaching the
choir, where Savonarola and his immediate friends were
still praying. Father Antonio, too, seized a sword from
the hand of a fallen man and laid about him with an impetuosity
which would be inexplicable to any who do not
know what force there is in gentle natures when the objects
of their affections are assailed. The artist monk fought
for his master with the blind desperation with which a
woman fights over the cradle of her child.</p>

<p>All in vain! Past midnight, and the news comes that
artillery is planted to blow down the walls of the convent,
and the magistracy, who up to this time have lifted not a
finger to repress the tumult, send word to Savonarola to
surrender himself to them, together with the two most active
of his companions, Fra Domenico da Pescia and Fra
Silvestro Maruffi, as the only means of averting the destruction
of the whole order. They offer him assurances of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
protection and safe return, which he does not in the least
believe: nevertheless, he feels that his hour is come, and
gives himself up.</p>

<p>His preparations were all made with a solemn method
which showed that he felt he was approaching the last act
in the drama of life. He called together his flock, scattered
and forlorn, and gave them his last words of fatherly
advice, encouragement, and comfort,&mdash;ending with the
remarkable declaration, "A Christian's life consists in doing
good and suffering evil." "I go with joy to this marriage-supper,"
he said, as he left the church for the last
sad preparations. He and his doomed friends then confessed
and received the sacrament, and after that he surrendered
himself into the hands of the men who he felt in his
prophetic soul had come to take him to torture and to
death.</p>

<p>As he gave himself into their hands, he said, "I commend
to your care this flock of mine, and these good
citizens of Florence who have been with us;" and then
once more turning to his brethren, said, "Doubt not, my
brethren. God will not fail to perfect His work. Whether
I live or die, He will aid and console you."</p>

<p>At this moment there was a struggle with the attendants
in the outer circle of the crowd, and the voice of Father
Antonio was heard crying out earnestly, "Do not hold me!
I will go with him! I must go with him!"</p>

<p>"Son," said Savonarola, "I charge you on your obedience
not to come. It is I and Fra Domenico who are to
die for the love of Christ." And thus, at the ninth hour
of the night, he passed the threshold of San Marco.</p>

<p>As he was leaving, a plaintive voice of distress was heard
from a young novice who had been peculiarly dear to
him, who stretched his hands after him, crying, "Father!
father! why do you leave us desolate?" Whereupon he
turned back a moment, and said, "God will be your help.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
If we do not see each other again in this world, we surely
shall in heaven."</p>

<p>When the party had gone forth, the monks and citizens
stood looking into each other's faces, listening with dismay
to the howl of wild ferocity that was rising around the
departing prisoner.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" was the outcry from many voices.</p>

<p>"I know what I shall do," said Agostino. "If any man
here will find me a fleet horse, I will start for Milan this
very hour; for my uncle is now there on a visit, and he is
a counselor of weight with the King of France: we must
get the King to interfere."</p>

<p>"Good! good! good!" rose from a hundred voices.</p>

<p>"I will go with you," said Father Antonio. "I shall
have no rest till I do something."</p>

<p>"And I," quoth Jacopo Niccolini, "will saddle for you,
without delay, two horses of part Arabian blood, swift
of foot, and easy, and which will travel day and night
without sinking."</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CATHEDRAL</span></h2>

<p>The rays of the setting sun were imparting even more
than their wonted cheerfulness to the airy and bustling
streets of Milan. There was the usual rush and roar of
busy life which mark the great city, and the display of gay
costumes and brilliant trappings proper to a ducal capital
which at that time gave the law to Europe in all matters
of taste and elegance, even as Paris does now. It was, in
fact, from the reputation of this city in matters of external
show that our English term Milliner was probably derived;
and one might well have believed this, who saw the sweep
of the ducal cortege at this moment returning in pomp from
the afternoon airing. Such glittering of gold-embroidered
mantles, such bewildering confusion of colors, such flashing
of jewelry from cap and dagger-hilt and finger-ring, and
even from bridle and stirrup, testified that the male sex at
this period in Italy were no whit behind the daughters of
Eve in that passion for personal adornment which our age
is wont to consider exclusively feminine. Indeed, all that
was visible to the vulgar eye of this pageant was wholly
masculine; though no one doubted that behind the gold-embroidered
curtains of the litters which contained the
female notabilities of the court still more dazzling wonders
might be concealed. Occasionally a white jeweled hand
would draw aside one of these screens, and a pair of eyes
brighter than any gems would peer forth; and then there
would be tokens of a visible commotion among the plumed
and gemmed cavaliers around, and one young head would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
nod to another with jests and quips, and there would be
bowing and curveting and all the antics and caracolings
supposable among gay young people on whom the sun shone
brightly, and who felt the world going well around them,
and deemed themselves the observed of all observers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the mute, subservient common people looked
on all this as a part of their daily amusement. Meek
dwellers in those dank, noisome caverns, without any opening
but a street-door, which are called dwelling-places in
Italy, they lived in uninquiring good-nature, contentedly
bringing up children on coarse bread, dirty cabbage-stumps,
and other garbage, while all that they could earn was sucked
upward by capillary attraction to nourish the extravagance
of those upper classes on which they stared with such blind
and ignorant admiration.</p>

<p>This was the lot they believed themselves born for, and
which every exhortation of their priests taught them to
regard as the appointed ordinance of God. The women, to
be sure, as women always will be, were true to the instinct
of their sex, and crawled out of the damp and vile-smelling
recesses of their homes with solid gold ear-rings shaking in
their ears, and their blue-black lustrous hair ornamented
with a glittering circle of steel pins or other quaint coiffure.
There was sense in all this: for had not even Dukes of
Milan been found so condescending and affable as to admire
the charms of the fair in the lower orders, whence had
come sons and daughters who took rank among princes and
princesses? What father, or what husband, would be insensible
to prospects of such honor? What priest would
not readily absolve such sin? Therefore one might have
observed more than one comely dark-eyed woman, brilliant
as some tropical bird in the colors of her peasant dress,
who cast coquettish glances toward high places, not unacknowledged
by patronizing nods in return, while mothers
and fathers looked on in triumph. These were the days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
for the upper classes; the Church bore them all in her
bosom as a tender nursing-mother, and provided for all
their little peccadilloes with even grandmotherly indulgence,
and in return the world was immensely deferential
towards the Church; and it was only now and then some
rugged John Baptist, in raiment of camel's hair, like Savonarola,
who dared to speak an indecorous word of God's
truth in the ear of power, and Herod and Herodias had
ever at hand the good old recipe for quieting such disturbances.
John Baptist was beheaded in prison, and then
all the world and all the Scribes and Pharisees applauded;
and only a few poor disciples were found to take up the
body and go and tell Jesus.</p>

<p>The whole piazza around the great Cathedral is at this
moment full of the dashing cavalcade of the ducal court,
looking as brilliant in the evening light as a field of poppy,
corn-flower, and scarlet clover at Sorrento; and there, amid
the flutter and rush, the amours and intrigues, the court
scandal, the laughing, the gibing, the glitter, and dazzle,
stands that wonderful Cathedral, that silent witness, that
strange, pure, immaculate mountain of airy, unearthly loveliness,&mdash;the
most striking emblem of God's mingled vastness
and sweetness that ever it was given to human heart
to devise or hands to execute. If there be among the
many mansions of our Father above, among the houses not
made with hands, aught purer and fairer, it must be the
work of those grand spirits who inspired and presided over
the erection of this celestial miracle of beauty. In the
great, vain, wicked city, all alive with the lust of the flesh,
the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, it seemed to stand
as much apart and alone as if it were in the solemn desolation
of the Campagna, or in one of the wide deserts of
Africa,&mdash;so little part or lot did it appear to have in anything
earthly, so little to belong to the struggling, bustling
crowd who beneath its white dazzling pinnacles seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
dwarfed into crawling insects. They who could look up
from the dizzy, frivolous life below saw far, far above
them, in the blue Italian air, thousands of glorified saints
standing on a thousand airy points of brilliant whiteness,
ever solemnly adoring. The marble which below was
somewhat touched and soiled with the dust of the street
seemed gradually to refine and brighten as it rose into the
pure regions of the air, till at last in those thousand distant
pinnacles it had the ethereal translucence of wintry frost-work,
and now began to glow with the violet and rose
hues of evening, in solemn splendor.</p>

<p>The ducal cortege sweeps by; but we have mounted the
dizzy, dark staircase that leads to the roof, where, amid the
bustling life of the city there is a promenade of still and
wondrous solitude. One seems to have ascended in those
few moments far beyond the tumult and dust of earthly
things, to the silence, the clearness, the tranquillity of
ethereal regions. The noise of the rushing tides of life
below rises only in a soft and distant murmur; while
around, in the wide, clear distance, is spread a prospect
which has not on earth its like or its equal. The beautiful
plains of Lombardy lie beneath like a map, and the northern
horizon-line is glittering with the entire sweep of the
Alps, like a solemn senate of archangels with diamond mail
and glittering crowns. Mont Blanc, Monte Rosa with its
countenance of light, the Jungfrau and all the weird brothers
of the Oberland, rise one after another to the delighted
gaze, and the range of the Tyrol melts far off into
the blue of the sky. On another side, the Apennines,
with their picturesque outlines and cloud-spotted sides,
complete the enclosure. All around, wherever the eye
turns, is the unbroken phalanx of mountains; and this
temple, with its thousand saintly statues standing in attitudes
of ecstasy and prayer, seems like a worthy altar and
shrine for the beautiful plain which the mountains enclose:
it seems to give all Northern Italy to God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
The effect of the statues in this high, pure air, in this
solemn, glorious scenery, is peculiar. They seem a meet
companionship for these exalted regions. They seem to
stand exultant on their spires, poised lightly as ethereal
creatures, the fit inhabitants of the pure blue sky. One
feels that they have done with earth; one can fancy them
a band of white-robed kings and priests forever ministering
in that great temple of which the Alps and the Apennines
are the walls and the Cathedral the heart and centre.
Never were Art and Nature so majestically married by
Religion in so worthy a temple.</p>

<p>One form could be discerned standing in rapt attention,
gazing from a platform on the roof upon the far-distant
scene. He was enveloped in the white coarse woolen gown
of the Dominican monks, and seemed wholly absorbed in
meditating on the scene before him, which appeared to
move him deeply; for, raising his hands, he repeated aloud
from the Latin Vulgate the words of an <span class="locked">Apostle:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Accessistis ad Sion montem et civitatem Dei viventis,

<p>At this moment the evening worship commenced within
the Cathedral, and the whole building seemed to vibrate
with the rising swell of the great organ, while the grave,
long-drawn tones of the Ambrosian Liturgy rose surging
in waves and dying away in distant murmurs, like the
rolling of the tide on some ocean-shore. The monk turned
and drew near to the central part of the roof to listen, and
as he turned he disclosed the well-known features of Father
Antonio.</p>

<p>Haggard, weary, and travel-worn, his first impulse, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
entering the city, was to fly to this holy solitude, as the
wandering sparrow of sacred song sought her nest amid the
altars of God's temple. Artist no less than monk, he
found in this wondrous shrine of beauty a repose both for
his artistic and his religious nature; and while waiting for
Agostino Sarelli to find his uncle's residence, he had determined
to pass the interval in this holy solitude. Many
hours had he paced alone up and down the long promenades
of white marble which run everywhere between forests
of dazzling pinnacles and flying buttresses of airy lightness.
Now he rested in fixed attention against the wall
above the choir, which he could feel pulsating with throbs
of sacred sound, as if a great warm heart were beating
within the fair marble miracle, warming it into mysterious
life and sympathy.</p>

<p>"I would now that boy were here to worship with me,"
he said. "No wonder the child's faith fainteth: it takes
such monuments as these of the Church's former days to
strengthen one's hopes. Ah, woe unto those by whom such
offense cometh!"</p>

<p>At this moment the form of Agostino was seen ascending
the marble staircase.</p>

<p>The eye of the monk brightened as he came towards
him. He put out one hand eagerly to take his, and raised
the other with a gesture of silence.</p>

<p>"Look," he said, "and listen! Is it not the sound of
many waters and mighty thunderings?"</p>

<p>Agostino stood subdued for the moment by the magnificent
sights and sounds; for, as the sun went down, the
distant mountains grew every moment more unearthly in
their brilliancy; and as they lay in a long line, jeweled
brightness mingling with the cloud-wreaths of the far horizon,
one might have imagined that he in truth beheld the
foundations of that celestial city of jasper, pearl, and translucent
gold which the Apostle saw, and that the risings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
and fallings of choral sound which seemed to thrill and
pulsate through the marble battlements were indeed that
song like many waters sung by the Church Triumphant
above.</p>

<p>For a few moments the monk and the young man stood
in silence, till at length the monk spoke.</p>

<p>"You have told me, my son, that your heart often troubles
you in being more Roman than Christian; that you
sometimes doubt whether the Church on earth be other
than a fiction or a fable. But look around us. Who are
these, this great multitude who praise and pray continually
in this temple of the upper air? These are they who have
come out of great tribulation, having washed their robes
and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. These
are not the men that have sacked cities, and made deserts,
and written their triumphs in blood and carnage. These
be men that have sheltered the poor, and built houses for
orphans, and sold themselves into slavery to redeem their
brothers in Christ. These be pure women who have
lodged saints, brought up children, lived holy and prayerful
lives. These be martyrs who have laid down their lives for
the testimony of Jesus. There were no such churches in
old Rome,&mdash;no such saints."</p>

<p>"Well," said Agostino, "one thing is certain. If such
be the True Church, the Pope and the Cardinals of our day
have no part in it; for they are the men who sack cities
and make desolations, who devour widows' houses and for
a pretense make long prayers. Let us see one of <i>them</i>
selling himself into slavery for the love of anybody, while
they seek to keep all the world in slavery to themselves!"</p>

<p>"That is the grievous declension our master weeps over,"
said the monk. "Ah, if the Bishops of the Church now
were like brave old Saint Ambrose, strong alone by faith
and prayer, showing no more favor to an unrepentant Emperor
than to the meanest slave, then would the Church be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
a reality and a glory! Such is my master. Never is he
afraid of the face of king or lord, when he has God's truth
to speak. You should have heard how plainly he dealt
with our Lorenzo de' Medici on his death-bed,&mdash;how he
refused him absolution, unless he would make restitution
to the poor and restore the liberties of Florence."</p>

<p>"I should have thought," said the young man, sarcastically,
"that Lorenzo the Magnificent might have got absolution
cheaper than that. Where were all the bishops in
his dominion, that he must needs send for Jerome Savonarola?"</p>

<p>"Son, it is ever so," replied the monk. "If there be
a man that cares neither for Duke nor Emperor, but for
God alone, then Dukes and Emperors would give more for
his good word than for a whole dozen of common priests."</p>

<p>"I suppose it is something like a rare manuscript or a
singular gem: these <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">virtuosi</i> have no rest till they have
clutched it. The thing they cannot get is always the thing
they want."</p>

<p>"Lorenzo was always seeking our master," said the
monk. "Often would he come walking in our gardens,
expecting surely he would hasten down to meet him; and
the brothers would run all out of breath to his cell to say,
'Father, Lorenzo is in the garden.' 'He is welcome,'
would he answer, with his pleasant smile. 'But, father,
will you not descend to meet him?' 'Hath he asked for
me?' 'No.' 'Well, then, let us not interrupt his meditations,'
he would answer, and remain still at his reading,
so jealous was he lest he should seek the favor of princes
and forget God, as does all the world in our day."</p>

<p>"And because he does not seek the favor of the men of
this world he will be trampled down and slain. Will the
God in whom he trusts defend him?"</p>

<p>The monk pointed expressively upward to the statues
that stood glorified above them, still wearing a rosy radiance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
though the shadows of twilight had fallen on all the
city below.</p>

<p>"My son," he said, "the victories of the True Church
are not in time, but in eternity. How many around us
were conquered on earth that they might triumph in
heaven! What saith the Apostle? 'They were tortured,
not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better
resurrection.'"</p>

<p>"But, alas!" said Agostino, "are we never to see the
right triumph here? I fear that this noble name is written
in blood, like so many of whom the world is not worthy.
Can one do nothing to help it?"</p>

<p>"How is that? What have you heard?" said the
monk, eagerly. "Have you seen your uncle?"</p>

<p>"Not yet; he is gone into the country for a day,&mdash;so
say his servants. I saw, when the Duke's court passed,
my cousin, who is in his train, and got a moment's speech
with him; and he promised, that, if I would wait for him
here, he would come to me as soon as he could be let off
from his attendance. When he comes, it were best that
we confer alone."</p>

<p>"I will retire to the southern side," said the monk,
"and await the end of your conference;" and with that he
crossed the platform on which they were standing, and,
going down a flight of white marble steps, was soon lost to
view amid the wilderness of frost-like carved work.</p>

<p>He had scarcely vanished, before footsteps were heard
ascending the marble staircase on the other side, and the
sound of a voice humming a popular air of the court.</p>

<p>The stranger was a young man of about five-and-twenty,
habited with all that richness and brilliancy of coloring
which the fashion of the day permitted to a young exquisite.
His mantle of purple velvet falling jauntily off from
one shoulder disclosed a doublet of amber satin richly embroidered
with gold and seed-pearl. The long white plume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
which drooped from his cap was held in its place by a large
diamond which sparkled like a star in the evening twilight.
His finely moulded hands were loaded with rings, and
ruffles of the richest Venetian lace encircled his wrists.
He had worn over all a dark cloak with a peaked hood, the
usual evening disguise in Italy; but as he gained the top-stair
of the platform, he threw it carelessly down and gayly
offered his hand.</p>

<p>"Good even to you, cousin mine! So you see I am as
true to my appointment as if your name were Leonora or
Camilla instead of Agostino. How goes it with you? I
wanted to talk with you below, but I saw we must have a
place without listeners. Our friends the saints are too
high in heavenly things to make mischief by eavesdropping."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Cousin Carlos, for your promptness. And
now to the point. Did your father, my uncle, get the letter
I wrote him about a month since?"</p>

<p>"He did; and he bade me treat with you about it. It's
an abominable snarl, this, they have got you into. My
father says, your best way is to come straight to him in
France, and abide till things take a better turn: he is high
in favor with the King and can find you a very pretty place
at court, and he takes it upon him in time to reconcile the
Pope. Between you and me, the old Pope has no special
spite in the world against <i>you</i>: he merely wants your lands
for his son, and as long as you prowl round and lay claim
to them, why, you must stay excommunicated; but just
clear the coast and leave them peaceably and he will put
you back into the True Church, and my father will charge
himself with your success. Popes don't last forever, or
there may come another falling out with the King of
France, and either way there will be a chance of your being
one day put back into your rights; meanwhile, a young
fellow might do worse than have a good place in our court."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
During this long monologue, which the young speaker
uttered with all the flippant self-sufficiency of worldly people
with whom the world is going well, the face of the
young nobleman who listened presented a picture of many
strong contending emotions.</p>

<p>"You speak," he said, "as if man had nothing to do in
this world but seek his own ease and pleasure. What lies
nearest my heart is not that I am plundered of my estates,
and my house uprooted, but it is that my beautiful Rome,
the city of my fathers, is a prisoner under the heel of the
tyrant. It is that the glorious religion of Christ, the holy
faith in which my mother died, the faith made venerable
by all these saints around us, is made the tool and instrument
of such vileness and cruelty that one is tempted to
doubt whether it were not better to have been born of
heathen in the good old times of the Roman Republic,&mdash;God
forgive me for saying so! Does the most Christian
King of France know that the man who pretends to rule
in the name of Christ is not a believer in the Christian religion,&mdash;that
he does not believe even in a God,&mdash;that
he obtained the holy seat by simony,&mdash;that he uses all
its power to enrich a brood of children whose lives are so
indecent that it is a shame to modest lips even to <i>say</i> what
they do?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course," said the other, "the King of France
is pretty well informed about all these things. You know
old King Charles, when he marched through Italy, had
more than half a mind, they say, to pull the old Pope out
of his place; and he might have done it easily. My father
was in his train at that time, and he says the Pope was
frightened enough. Somehow they made it all up among
them, and settled about their territories, which is the main
thing, after all; and now our new King, I fancy, does not
like to meddle with him: between you and me, he has his
eye in another direction here. This gay city would suit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
him admirably, and he fancies he can govern it as well as
it is governed now. My father does not visit here with
his eyes shut, I can tell you. But as to the Pope&mdash;Well,
you see such things are delicate to handle. After
all, my dear Agostino, we are not priests,&mdash;our business
is with this world; and, no matter how they came by them,
these fellows have the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and
one cannot afford to quarrel with them,&mdash;we must have
the ordinances, you know, or what becomes of our souls?
Do you suppose, now, that I should live as gay and easy
a life as I do, if I thought there were any doubt of my
salvation? It's a mercy to us sinners that the ordinances
are not vitiated by the sins of the priests; it would go hard
with us, if they were: as it is, if they will live scandalous
lives, it is their affair, not ours."</p>

<p>"And is it nothing," replied the other, "to a true man
who has taken the holy vows of knighthood on him,
whether his Lord's religion be defamed and dishonored
and made a scandal and a scoffing? Did not all Europe go
out to save Christ's holy sepulchre from being dishonored
by the feet of the Infidel? and shall we let infidels have
the very house of the Lord, and reign supreme in his holy
dwelling-place? There has risen a holy prophet in Italy,
the greatest since the time of Saint Francis, and his preaching
hath stirred all hearts to live more conformably with
our holy faith; and now for his pure life and good works
he is under excommunication of the Pope, and they have
seized and imprisoned him, and threaten his life."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean Savonarola," said the other. "Yes, we
have heard of him,&mdash;a most imprudent, impracticable fellow,
who will not take advice nor be guided. My father,
I believe, thought well of him once, and deemed that in
the distracted state of Italy he might prove serviceable in
forwarding some of his plans: but he is wholly wrapt up
in his own notions; he heeds no will but his own."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
"Have you heard anything," said Agostino, "of a letter
which he wrote to the King of France lately, stirring him
up to call a General Council of the Christian Church to
consider what is to be done about the scandals at Rome?"</p>

<p>"Then he has written one, has he?" replied the young
man; "then the story that I have heard whispered about
here must be true. A man who certainly is in a condition
to know told me day before yesterday that the Duke had
arrested a courier with some such letter, and sent it on to
the Pope: it is likely, for the Duke hates Savonarola. If
that be true, it will go hard with him yet; for the Pope
has a long arm for an enemy."</p>

<p>"And so," said Agostino, with an expression of deep
concern, "that letter, from which the good man hoped so
much, and which was so powerful, will only go to increase
his danger!"</p>

<p>"The more fool he!&mdash;he might have known that it was
of no use. Who was going to take his part against the
Pope?"</p>

<p>"The city of Florence has stood by him until lately,"
said Agostino, "and would again, with a little help."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! never think it, my dear Agostino! Depend
upon it, it will end as such things always do, and the
man is only a madman that undertakes it. Hark ye,
cousin, what have <i>you</i> to do with this man? Why do you
attach yourself to the side that is <i>sure</i> to lose? I cannot
conceive what you would be at. This is no way to mend
your fortunes. Come to-night to my father's palace: the
Duke has appointed us princely lodgings, and treats us
with great hospitality, and my father has plans for your
advantage. Between us, there is a fair young ward of his,
of large estates and noble blood, whom he designs for you.
So you see, if you turn your attention in this channel,
there may come a reinforcement of the family property,
which will enable you to hold out until the Pope dies, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
some prince or other gets into a quarrel with him, which is
always happening, and then a move may be made for you.
My father, I'll promise you, is shrewd enough, and always
keeps his eye open to see where there is a joint in the harness,
and have a trusty dagger-blade all whetted to stick
under. Of course, he means to see you righted; he has
the family interest at heart, and feels as indignant as you
could at the rascality which has been perpetrated; but
I am quite sure he will tell you that the way is not to
come out openly against the Pope and join this fanatical
party."</p>

<p>Agostino stood silent, with the melancholy air of a man
who has much to say, and is deeply moved by considerations
which he perceives it would be utterly idle and useless
to attempt to explain. If the easy theology of his
friend were indeed true,&mdash;if the treasures of the heavenly
kingdom, glory, honor, and immortality, could indeed be
placed in unholy hands, to be bought and sold and traded
in,&mdash;if holiness of heart and life, and all those nobler
modes of living and being which were witnessed in the
histories of the thousand saints around him, were indeed
but a secondary thing in the strife for worldly place and
territory,&mdash;what, then, remained for the man of ideas, of
aspirations? In such a state of society, his track must be
like that of the dove in sacred history, who found no rest
for the sole of her foot.</p>

<p>Agostino folded his arms and sighed deeply, and then
made answer mechanically, as one whose thoughts are afar
off.</p>

<p>"Present my duty," he said, "to my uncle, your father,
and say to him that I will wait on him to-night."</p>

<p>"Even so," said the young man, picking up his cloak
and folding it about him. "And now, you know, I must
go. Don't be discouraged; keep up a good heart; you
shall see what it is to have powerful friends to stand by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
you; all will be right yet. Come, will you go with me
now?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Agostino, "I think I would be alone
a little while. My head is confused, and I would fain
think over matters a little quietly."</p>

<p>"Well, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">au revoir</i>, then. I must leave you to the company
of the saints. But be sure and come early."</p>

<p>So saying, he threw his cloak over his shoulder and
sauntered carelessly down the marble steps, humming again
the gay air with which he had ascended.</p>

<p>Left alone, Agostino once more cast a glance on the
strangely solemn and impressive scene around him. He
was standing on a platform of the central tower which overlooked
the whole building. The round, full moon had
now risen in the horizon, displacing by her solemn brightness
the glow of twilight; and her beams were reflected by
the delicate frost-work of the myriad pinnacles which rose
in a bewildering maze at his feet. It might seem to be
some strange enchanted garden of fairy-land, where a luxuriant
and freakish growth of Nature had been suddenly
arrested and frozen into eternal stillness. Around in the
shadows at the foot of the Cathedral, the lights of the great
gay city twinkled and danced and veered and fluttered like
fireflies in the damp, dewy shadows of some moist meadow
in summer. The sound of clattering hoofs and rumbling
wheels, of tinkling guitars and gay roundelays, rose out of
that obscure distance, seeming far off and plaintive like the
dream of a life that is past. The great church seemed a
vast world; the long aisles of statued pinnacles with their
pure floorings of white marble appeared as if they might be
the corridors of heaven; and it seemed as if the crowned
and sceptred saints in their white marriage-garments might
come down and walk there, without ever a spot of earth
on their unsullied whiteness.</p>

<p>In a few moments Father Antonio had glided back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
the side of the young man, whom he found so lost in reverie
that not till he laid his hand upon his arm did he
awaken from his meditations.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, with a start, "my father, is it you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my son. What of your conference? Have you
learned anything?"</p>

<p>"Father, I have learned far more than I wished to
know."</p>

<p>"What is it, my son? Speak it at once."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I fear that the letter of our holy father to
the King of France has been intercepted here in Milan,
and sent to the Pope."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" said the monk, with an
eagerness that showed how much he felt the intelligence.</p>

<p>"My cousin tells me that a person of consideration in
the Duke's household, who is supposed to be in a position
to know, told him that it was so."</p>

<p>Agostino felt the light grasp which the monk had laid
upon his arm gradually closing with a convulsive pressure,
and that he was trembling with intense feeling.</p>

<p>"Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight!"
he said, after a few moments of silence.</p>

<p>"It is discouraging," said Agostino, "to see how little
these princes care for the true interests of religion and the
service of God,&mdash;how little real fealty there is to our Lord
Jesus."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the monk, "all seek their own, and not the
things that are Christ's. It is well written, 'Put not your
trust in princes.'"</p>

<p>"And what prospect, what hope do you see for him?"
said Agostino. "Will Florence stand firm?"</p>

<p>"I could have thought so once," said the monk, "in
those days when I have seen counselors and nobles and
women of the highest degree all humbly craving to hear
the word of God from his lips, and seeming to seek nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
so much as to purify their houses, their hands, and their
hearts, that they might be worthy citizens of that commonwealth
which has chosen the Lord Jesus for its gonfalonier.
I have seen the very children thronging to kiss the hem of
his robe, as he walked through the streets; but, oh, my
friend, did not Jerusalem bring palms and spread its garments
in the way of Christ only four days before he was
crucified?"</p>

<p>The monk's voice here faltered. He turned away, and
seemed to wrestle with a tempest of suppressed sobbing.
A moment more, he looked heavenward and pointed up
with a smile.</p>

<p>"Son," he said, "you ask what hope there is. I answer,
There is hope of such crowns as these wear who came
out of great tribulation and now reign with Christ in
glory."</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PILGRIMAGE</span></h2>

<p>The morning sun rose clear and lovely on the old red
rocks of Sorrento, and danced in a thousand golden scales
and ripples on the wide Mediterranean. The shadows of
the gorge were pierced by long golden shafts of light, here
falling on some moist bed of crimson cyclamen, there
shining through a waving tuft of gladiolus, or making
the abundant yellow fringes of the broom more vivid in
their brightness. The velvet-mossy old bridge, in the far
shadows at the bottom, was lit up by a chance beam, and
seemed as if it might be something belonging to fairy-land.</p>

<p>There had been a bustle and stir betimes in the little
dove-cot, for to-morrow the inmates were to leave it for a
long, adventurous journey.</p>

<p>To old Elsie, the journey back to Rome, the city of her
former days of prosperity, the place which had witnessed
her ambitious hopes, her disgrace and downfall, was full of
painful ideas. There arose to her memory, like a picture,
those princely halls, with their slippery, cold mosaic floors,
their long galleries of statues and paintings, their enchanting
gardens, musical with the voice of mossy fountains,
fragrant with the breath of roses and jasmines, where the
mother of Agnes had spent the hours of her youth and
beauty. She seemed to see her flitting hither and thither
down the stately ilex-avenues, like some gay singing-bird,
to whom were given gilded cages and a constant round of
caresses and sweets, or like the flowers in the parterres,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
which lived and died only as the graceful accessories of the
grandeur of an old princely family.</p>

<p>She compared, mentally, the shaded and secluded life
which Agnes had led with the specious and fatal brilliancy
which had been the lot of her mother,&mdash;her simple peasant
garb with those remembered visions of jewelry and silk
and embroideries with which the partial patronage of the
Duchess or the ephemeral passion of her son had decked
out the poor Isella; and then came swelling at her heart
a tumultuous thought, one which she had repressed and
kept down for years with all the force of pride and hatred.
Agnes, peasant-girl though she seemed, had yet the blood
of that proud old family in her veins; the marriage had
been a true one; she herself had witnessed it.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," she said to herself, "were justice done,
she would now be a princess,&mdash;a fit mate for the nobles of
the land; and here I ask no more than to mate her to an
honest smith,&mdash;I that have seen a prince kneel to kiss her
mother's hand,&mdash;yes, he did,&mdash;entreat her on his knees
to be his wife,&mdash;I saw it. But then, what came of it?
Was there ever one of these nobles that kept oath or promise
to us of the people, or that cared for us longer than the
few moments we could serve his pleasure? Old Elsie, you
have done wisely! keep your dove out of the eagle's nest:
it is foul with the blood of poor innocents whom he has
torn to pieces in his cruel pride!"</p>

<p>These thoughts swelled in silence in the mind of Elsie,
while she was busy sorting and arranging her household
stores, and making those thousand-and-one preparations
known to every householder, whether of much or little,
who meditates a long journey.</p>

<p>To Agnes she seemed more than ever severe and hard;
yet probably there never was a time when every pulse of
her heart was beating more warmly for the child, and every
thought of the future was more entirely regulated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
reference to her welfare. It is no sinecure to have the entire
devotion of a strong, enterprising, self-willed friend, as
Agnes had all her life found. One cannot gather grapes
of thorns or figs of thistles, and the affection of thorny and
thistly natures has often as sharp an acid and as long prickers
as wild gooseberries; yet it is their best, and must be so
accepted.</p>

<p>Agnes tried several times to offer her help to her grandmother,
but was refused so roughly that she dared not offer
again, and therefore went to her favorite station by the
parapet in the garden, whence she could look up and down
the gorge, and through the arches of the old mossy Roman
bridge that spanned it far down by the city-wall. All
these things had become dear to her by years of familiar
silent converse. The little garden, with its old sculptured
basin and the ever-lulling dash of falling water; the
tremulous draperies of maiden's-hair, always beaded with
shining drops; the old shrine, with its picture, its lamp,
and flower-vase; the tall, dusky orange-trees, so full of
blossoms and fruit, so smooth and shining in their healthy
bark,&mdash;all seemed to her as so many dear old friends whom
she was about to leave, perhaps forever.</p>

<p>What this pilgrimage would be like, she scarcely knew:
days and weeks of wandering,&mdash;over mountain-passes;
in deep, solitary valleys,&mdash;as years ago, when her grandmother
brought her, a little child, from Rome.</p>

<p>In the last few weeks, Agnes seemed to herself to have
become wholly another being. Silently, insensibly, her
feet had crossed the enchanted river that divides childhood
from womanhood, and all the sweet ignorant joys of that
first early paradise lay behind her. Up to this time her
life had seemed to her a charming dream, full of blessed
visions and images: legends of saints, and hymns, and
prayers had blended with flower-gatherings in the gorge,
and light daily toils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
Now a new, strange life had been born within her,&mdash;a
life full of passions, contradictions, and conflicts. A
love had sprung up in her heart, strange and wonderful,
for one who till within these few weeks had been entirely
unknown to her, who had never toiled for, or housed, or
clothed, or cared for her as her grandmother had, and yet
whom a few short interviews, a few looks, a few words,
had made to seem nearer and dearer than the old, tried
friends of her childhood. In vain she confessed it as a
sin, in vain she strove against it; it came back to her in
every hymn, in every prayer. Then she would press the
sharp cross to her breast, till a thousand stings of pain
would send the blood in momentary rushes to her pale
cheek, and cause her delicate lips to contract with an expression
of stern endurance, and pray that by any penance
and anguish she might secure his salvation.</p>

<p>To save one such glorious soul, she said to herself, was
work enough for one little life. She was willing to spend
it all in endurance, unseen by him, unknown to him, so
that at last he should be received into that Paradise which
her ardent imagination conceived so vividly. Surely, there
she should meet him, radiant as the angel of her dream;
and then she would tell him that it was all for his sake
that she had refused to listen to him here. And these
sinful longings to see him once more, these involuntary
reachings of her soul after an earthly companionship, she
should find strength to overcome in this pilgrimage. She
should go to Rome,&mdash;the very city where the blessed Paul
poured out his blood for the Lord Jesus,&mdash;where Peter
fed the flock, till his time, too, came to follow his Lord in
the way of the cross. She should even come near to her
blessed Redeemer; she should go up, on her knees, those
very steps to Pilate's hall where He stood bleeding, crowned
with thorns,&mdash;His blood, perhaps, dropping on the very
stones. Ah, could any mortal love distract her there?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Should she not there find her soul made free of every
earthly thrall to love her Lord alone,&mdash;as she had loved
Him in the artless and ignorant days of her childhood,&mdash;but
better, a thousand times?</p>

<p>"Good-morning to you, pretty dove!" said a voice from
without the garden-wall; and Agnes, roused from her reverie,
saw old Jocunda.</p>

<p>"I came down to help you off," she said, as she came
into the little garden. "Why, my dear little saint! you
are looking white as a sheet, and with those tears! What's
it all for, baby?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Jocunda! grandmamma is angry with me all the
time now. I wish I could go once more to the convent
and see my dear Mother Theresa. She is angry, if I but
name it; and yet she will not let me do anything here to
help her, and so I don't know <i>what</i> to do."</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate, don't cry, pretty one! Your grandmamma
is worked with hard thoughts. We old folks are
twisted and crabbed and full of knots with disappointment
and trouble, like the mulberry-trees that they keep for
vines to run on. But I'll speak to her; I know her
ways; she shall let you go; I'll bring her round."</p>

<p>"So-ho, sister!" said the old soul, hobbling to the door
and looking in at Elsie, who was sitting flat on the stone
floor of her cottage, sorting a quantity of flax that lay
around her. The severe Roman profile was thrown out by
the deep shadows of the interior,&mdash;and the piercing black
eyes, the silver-white hair, and the strong, compressed
lines of the mouth, as she worked, and struggled with the
ghosts of her former life, made her look like no unapt personification
of one of the Fates reviewing her flax before
she commenced the spinning of some new web of destiny.</p>

<p>"Good-morning to you, sister!" said Jocunda. "I
heard you were off to-morrow, and I came to see what I
could do to help you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
"There's nothing to be done for me, but to kill me,"
said Elsie. "I am weary of living."</p>

<p>"Oh, never say that! Shake the dice again, my old
man used to say,&mdash;God rest his soul! Please Saint
Agnes, you'll have a brave pilgrimage."</p>

<p>"Saint Agnes be hanged!" said Elsie, gruffly. "I'm
out with her. It was she put all these notions into my
girl's head. Because she didn't get married herself, she
don't want any one else to. She has no consideration.
I've done with her: I told her so this morning. The
candles I've burned and the prayers I've gone through
with, that she might prosper me in this one thing! and
it's all gone against me. She's a baggage, and shall never
see another penny of mine,&mdash;that's flat!"</p>

<p>Such vituperation of saints and sacred images may be
heard to this day in Italy, and is a common feature of idol-worship
in all lands; for, however the invocation of the
saints could be vitalized in the hearts of the few spiritual,
there is no doubt that in the mass of the common people
it had all the well-defined symptoms of the grossest idolatry,
among which fits of passionate irreverence are one.
The feeling which tempts the enlightened Christian in sore
disappointment and vexation to rise in rebellion against a
wise Providence, in the childish twilight of uncultured natures
finds its full expression unawed by reverence or fear.</p>

<p>"Oh, hush, now!" said Jocunda. "What is the use
of making her angry just as you are going to Rome, where
she has the most power? All sorts of ill-luck will befall
you. Make up with her before you start, or you may get
the fever in the marshes and die, and then who will take
care of poor Agnes?"</p>

<p>"Let Saint Agnes look after her; the girl loves her better
than she does me, or anybody else," said Elsie. "If
she cared anything about me, she'd marry and settle down,
as I want her to."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
"Oh, there you are wrong," said Jocunda. "Marrying
is like your dinner: one is not always in stomach for it,
and one's meat is another's poison. Now who knows but
this pilgrimage may be the very thing to bring the girl
round? I've seen people cured of too much religion by
going to Rome. You know things ain't there as our little
saint fancies. Why, between you and me, the priests
themselves have their jokes on those who come so far to so
little purpose. More shame for 'em, say I, too; but we
common people mustn't look into such things too closely.
Now take it cheerfully, and you'll see the girl will come
back tired of tramping and able to settle down in a good
home with a likely husband. I have a brother in Naples
who is turning a pretty penny in the fisheries; I will give
you directions to find him; his wife is a wholesome Christian
woman; and if the little one be tired by the time
you get there, you might do worse than stop two or three
days with them. It's a brave city; seems made to have
a good time in. Come, you let her just run up to the
convent to bid good-by to the Mother Theresa and the
sisters."</p>

<p>"I don't care where she goes," said Elsie, ungraciously.</p>

<p>"There, now!" said Jocunda, coming out, "Agnes, your
grandmother bids you go to the convent to say good-by
to the sisters; so run along, there's a little dear. The
Mother Theresa talks of nothing else but you since she
heard that you meditated this; and she has broken in two
her own piece of the True Cross which she's carried in the
gold and pearl reliquary that the Queen sent her, and means
to give it to you. One doesn't halve such gifts, without
one's whole heart goes with them."</p>

<p>"Dear mother!" said Agnes, her eyes filling with tears,
"I will take her some flowers and oranges for the last time.
Do you know, Jocunda, I feel that I never shall come back
here to this dear little home where I have been so happy,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>everything
sounds so mournful and looks so mournful!&mdash;I
love everything here so much!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear child, never give in to such fancies, but pluck
up heart. You will be sure to have luck, wherever you
go,&mdash;especially since the mother will give you that holy
relic. I myself had a piece of Saint John Baptist's thumbnail
sewed up in a leather bag, which I wore day and night
all the years I was tramping up and down with my old
man; but when he died, I had it buried with him to ease
his soul. For you see, dear, he was a trooper, and led
such a rackety up-and-down life, that I doubt but his confessions
were but slipshod, and he needed all the help he
could get, poor old soul! It's a comfort to think he has
it."</p>

<p>"Ah, Jocunda, seems to me it were better to trust to
the free love of our dear Lord who died for us, and pray
to Him, without ceasing, for his soul."</p>

<p>"Like enough, dearie; but then, one can't be too sure,
you know. And there isn't the least doubt in my mind
that that was a true relic, for I got it in the sack of the
city of Volterra, out of the private cabinet of a noble lady,
with a lot of jewels and other matters that made quite a
little purse for us. Ah, that was a time, when that city
was sacked! It was hell upon earth for three days, and
all our men acted like devils incarnate; but then they always
will in such cases. But go your ways now, dearie,
and I'll stay with your grandmamma; for, please God, you
must be up and away with the sun to-morrow."</p>

<p>Agnes hastily arranged a little basket of fruit and flowers,
and took her way down through the gorge, under the
Roman bridge, through an orange-orchard, and finally came
out upon the seashore, and so along the sands below the
cliffs on which the old town of Sorrento is situated.</p>

<p>So cheating and inconsistent is the human heart, especially
in the feminine subject, that she had more than once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
occasion to chide herself for the thrill with which she remembered
passing the cavalier once in this orange-garden,
and the sort of vague hope which she detected that somewhere
along this road he might appear again.</p>

<p>"How perfectly wicked and depraved I must be," she
said to herself, "to find any pleasure in such a thought of
one I should pray never to meet again!"</p>

<p>And so the little soul went on condemning herself in
those exaggerated terms which the religious vocabulary of
conventual life furnished ready-made for the use of penitents
of every degree, till by the time she arrived at the
convent she could scarcely have been more oppressed with
a sense of sin, if she had murdered her grandmother and
eloped with the cavalier.</p>

<p>On her arrival in the convent court, the peaceful and
dreamy stillness contrasted strangely with the gorgeous
brightness of the day outside. The splendid sunshine, the
sparkling seas, the songs of the boatmen, the brisk passage
of gliding sails, the bright hues of the flowers that garlanded
the rocks, all seemed as if the earth had been arrayed
for some gala-day; but the moment she had passed the
portal, the silent, mossy court, with its pale marble nymph,
its lull of falling water, its turf snow-dropt with daisies and
fragrant with blue and white violets, and the surrounding
cloistered walks, with their pictured figures of pious history,
all came with a sad and soothing influence on her
nerves.</p>

<p>The nuns, who had heard the news of the projected pilgrimage,
and regarded it as the commencement of that saintly
career which they had always predicted for her, crowded
around her, kissing her hands and her robe, and entreating
her prayers at different shrines of especial sanctity that she
might visit.</p>

<p>The Mother Theresa took her to her cell, and there hung
round her neck, by a golden chain, the relic which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
designed for her, and of whose genuineness she appeared
to possess no manner of doubt.</p>

<p>"But how pale you are, my sweet child!" she said.
"What has happened to alter you so much? Your cheeks
look so thin, and there are deep, dark circles round your
eyes."</p>

<p>"Ah, my mother, it is because of my sins."</p>

<p>"Your sins, dear little one! What sins can you be
guilty of?"</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear mother, I have been false to my Lord,
and let the love of an earthly creature into my heart."</p>

<p>"What can you mean?" said the mother.</p>

<p>"Alas, dear mother, the cavalier who sent that ring!"
said Agnes, covering her face with her hands.</p>

<p>Now the Mother Theresa had never left the walls of
that convent since she was ten years old,&mdash;had seen no
men except her father and uncle, who once or twice made
her a short call, and an old hunchback who took care of
their garden, safe in his armor of deformity. Her ideas
on the subject of masculine attractions were, therefore, as
vague as might be the conceptions of the eyeless fishes in
the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky with regard to the fruits
and flowers above ground. All that portion of her womanly
nature which might have throbbed lay in a dead calm.
Still there was a faint flutter of curiosity, as she pressed
Agnes to tell her story, which she did with many pauses
and sobs and blushes.</p>

<p>"And is he so very handsome, my little heart?" she
said, after listening. "What makes you love him so much
in so little time?"</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;he is beautiful as an angel."</p>

<p>"I never saw a young man, really," said the Mother
Theresa. "Uncle Angelo was lame, and had gray hair;
and papa was very fat, and had a red face. Perhaps he
looks like our picture of Saint Sebastian;&mdash;I have often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
thought that I might be in danger of loving a young man
that looked like him."</p>

<p>"Oh, he is more beautiful than that picture or any picture!"
said Agnes, fervently; "and, mother, though he
is excommunicated, I can't help feeling that he is as good
as he is beautiful. My uncle had strong hopes that he
should restore him to the True Church; and to pray for
his soul I am going on this pilgrimage. Father Francesco
says, if I will tear away and overcome this love, I shall
gain so much merit that my prayers will have power to
save his soul. Promise me, dear mother, that you and all
the sisters will help me with your prayers;&mdash;help me to
work out this great salvation, and then I shall be so glad
to come back here and spend all my life in prayer!"</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MOUNTAIN FORTRESS</span></h2>

<p>And so on a bright spring morning our pilgrims started.
Whoever has traversed the road from Sorrento to Naples,
that wonderful path along the high rocky shores of the
Mediterranean, must remember it only as a wild dream of
enchantment. On one side lies the sea, shimmering in
bands of blue, purple, and green to the swaying of gentle
winds, exhibiting those magical shiftings and changes of
color peculiar to these waves. Near the land its waters
are of pale, transparent emerald, while farther out they
deepen into blue and thence into a violet-purple, which
again, towards the horizon-line, fades into misty pearl-color.
The shores rise above the sea in wild, bold precipices,
grottoed into fantastic caverns by the action of the
waves, and presenting every moment some new variety of
outline. As the path of the traveler winds round promontories
whose mountain-heights are capped by white villages
and silvery with olive-groves, he catches the enchanting
sea-view, now at this point, and now at another, with
Naples glimmering through the mists in the distance, and
the purple sides of Vesuvius ever changing with streaks
and veins of cloud-shadows, while silver vapors crown the
summit. Above the road the steep hills seem piled up to
the sky,&mdash;every spot terraced, and cultivated with some
form of vegetable wealth, and the wild, untamable rocks
garlanded over with golden broom, crimson gillyflowers,
and a thousand other bright adornments. The road lies
through villages whose gardens and orange-orchards fill the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
air with sweet scents, and whose rose-hedges sometimes
pour a perfect cascade of bloom and fragrance over the
walls.</p>

<p>Our travelers started in the dewy freshness of one of
those gorgeous days which seem to cast an illuminating
charm over everything. Even old Elsie's stern features
relaxed somewhat under the balmy influences of sun and
sky, and Agnes's young, pale face was lit up with a brighter
color than for many a day before. Their pilgrimage through
this beautiful country had few incidents. They walked in
the earlier and latter parts of the day, reposing a few hours
at noon near some fountain or shrine by the wayside,&mdash;often
experiencing the kindly veneration of the simple
peasantry, who cheerfully offered them refreshments, and
begged their prayers at the holy places whither they were
going.</p>

<p>In a few days they reached Naples, where they made a
little stop with the hospitable family to whom Jocunda had
recommended them. From Naples their path lay through
the Pontine Marshes; and though the malaria makes this
region a word of fear, yet it is no less one of strange, soft,
enchanting beauty. A wide, sea-like expanse, clothed with
an abundance of soft, rich grass, painted with golden bands
and streaks of bright yellow flowers, stretches away to a
purple curtain of mountains, whose romantic outline rises
constantly in a thousand new forms of beauty. The upland
at the foot of these mountains is beautifully diversified
with tufts of trees, and the contrast of the purple softness
of the distant hills with the dazzling gold and emerald of
the wide meadow-tracts they enclose is a striking feature
in the landscape. Droves of silver-haired oxen, with their
great, dreamy, dark eyes and polished black horns, were
tranquilly feeding knee-deep in the lush, juicy grass, and
herds of buffaloes, uncouth, but harmless, might be seen
pasturing or reposing in the distance. On either side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
the way were waving tracts of yellow fleur-de-lis, and beds
of arum, with its arrowy leaves and white blossoms. It
was a wild luxuriance of growth, a dreamy stillness of solitude,
so lovely that one could scarce remember that it was
deadly.</p>

<p>Elsie was so impressed with the fear of the malaria, that
she trafficked with an honest peasant, who had been hired
to take back to Rome the horses which had been used to
convey part of the suite of a nobleman traveling to Naples,
to give them a quicker passage across than they could have
made on foot. It is true that this was quite contrary to
the wishes of Agnes, who felt that the journey ought to be
performed in the most toilsome and self-renouncing way,
and that they should trust solely to prayer and spiritual
protection to ward off the pestilential exhalations.</p>

<p>In vain she quoted the Psalm, "Thou shalt not be afraid
for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flieth by
day, nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor
for the destruction that wasteth at noon-day," and adduced
cases of saints who had walked unhurt through all sorts of
dangers.</p>

<p>"There's no use talking, child," said Elsie. "I'm
older than you, and have seen more of real men and women;
and whatever they did in old times, I know that
nowadays the saints don't help those that don't take care
of themselves; and the long and the short of it is, we must
ride across those marshes, and get out of them as quick as
possible, or we shall get into Paradise quicker than we
want to."</p>

<p>In common with many other professing Christians, Elsie
felt that going to Paradise was the very dismalest of alternatives,&mdash;a
thing to be staved off as long as possible.</p>

<p>After many days of journeying, the travelers, somewhat
weary and foot-sore, found themselves in a sombre and
lonely dell of the mountains, about an hour before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
going down of the sun. The slanting yellow beams turned
to silvery brightness the ashy foliage of the gnarled old
olives, which gaunt and weird clung with their great,
knotty, straggling roots to the rocky mountain-sides. Before
them, the path, stony, steep, and winding, was rising
upward and still upward, and no shelter for the night appeared,
except in a distant mountain-town, which, perched
airily as an eagle's nest on its hazy height, reflected from
the dome of its church and its half-ruined old feudal tower
the golden light of sunset. A drowsy-toned bell was ringing
out the Ave Maria over the wide purple solitude of
mountains, whose varying outlines were rising around.</p>

<p>"You are tired, my little heart," said old Elsie to Agnes,
who had drooped during a longer walk than usual.</p>

<p>"No, grandmamma," said Agnes, sinking on her knees
to repeat her evening prayer, which she did, covering her
face with her hands.</p>

<p>Old Elsie kneeled too; but, as she was praying,&mdash;being
a thrifty old body in the use of her time,&mdash;she cast an
eye up the steep mountain-path and calculated the distance
of the little airy village. Just at that moment she
saw two or three horsemen, who appeared to be stealthily
observing them from behind the shadow of some large
rocks.</p>

<p>When their devotions were finished, she hurried on her
grandchild <span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Come, dearie! it must be we shall find a shelter
soon."</p>

<p>The horsemen now rode up behind them.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, mother!" said one of them, speaking
from under the shadow of a deeply slouched hat.</p>

<p>Elsie made no reply, but hurried forward.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, pretty maid!" he said again, riding
still nearer.</p>

<p>"Go your ways in the name of God," said Elsie. "We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
are pilgrims, going for our souls to Rome; and whoever
hinders us will have the saints to deal with."</p>

<p>"Who talks of hindering you, mother?" responded the
other. "On the contrary, we come for the express purpose
of helping you along."</p>

<p>"We want none of your help," said Elsie, gruffly.</p>

<p>"See, now, how foolish you are!" said the horseman.
"Don't you see that that town is a good seven miles off,
and not a bit of bed or supper to be had till you get there,
and the sun will be down soon? So mount up behind me,
and here is a horse for the little one."</p>

<p>In fact, the horsemen at this moment opening disclosed
to view a palfrey with a lady's saddle, richly caparisoned,
as if for a person of condition. With a sudden movement,
two of the men dismounted, confronted the travelers, and
the one who had acted as spokesman, approaching Agnes,
said, in a tone somewhat <span class="locked">imperative,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Come, young lady, it is our master's will that your
poor little feet should have some rest."</p>

<p>And before Agnes could remonstrate, he raised her into
the saddle as easily as if she had been a puff of thistledown,
and then turning to Elsie, he <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"For you, good mother, if you wish to keep up, you
must e'en be content with a seat behind me."</p>

<p>"Who are you? and how dare you?" said Elsie, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Good mother," said the man, "you see God's will is
that you should submit, because we are four to you two,
and there are fifty more within call. So get up without
more words, and I swear by the Holy Virgin no harm shall
be done you."</p>

<p>Elsie looked and saw Agnes already some distance before
her, the bridle of her palfrey being held by one of the
horsemen, who rode by her side and seemed to look after
her carefully; and so, without more ado, she accepted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
services of the man, and, placing her foot on the toe of his
riding-boot, mounted to the crupper behind him.</p>

<p>"That is right," said he. "Now hold on to me lustily,
and be not afraid."</p>

<p>So saying, the whole troop began winding as rapidly as
possible up the steep, rocky path to the mountain-town.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the surprise and alarm of this most
unexpected adventure, Agnes, who had been at the very
point of exhaustion from fatigue, could not but feel the
sensation of relief and repose which the seat in an easy
saddle gave her. The mountain air, as they rose, breathed
fresh and cold on her brow, and a prospect of such wondrous
beauty unrolled beneath her feet that her alarm soon
became lost in admiration. The mountains that rose everywhere
around them seemed to float in a transparent sea of
luminous vapor, with olive-orchards and well-tilled fields
lying in far, dreamy distances below, while out towards the
horizon silver gleams of the Mediterranean gradually widened
to the view. Soothed by the hour, refreshed by the air,
and filled with admiration for the beauty of all she saw,
she surrendered herself to her situation with a feeling of
solemn religious calm, as to some unfolding of the Divine
Will, which might unroll like the landscape beneath her.
They pursued their way in silence, rising higher and higher
out of the shadows of the deep valleys below, the man who
conducted them observing a strict reserve, but seeming to
have a care for their welfare.</p>

<p>The twilight yet burned red in the sky, and painted
with solemn lights the mossy walls of the little old town,
as they plunged under a sombre antique gateway, and entered
on a street as damp and dark as a cellar, which went
up almost perpendicularly between tall, black stone walls
that seemed to have neither windows nor doors. Agnes
could only remember clambering upward, turning short
corners, clattering down steep stone steps, under low archways,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
along narrow, ill-smelling passages, where the light
that seemed so clear without the town was almost extinguished
in utter night.</p>

<p>At last they entered the damp court of a huge, irregular
pile of stone buildings. Here the men suddenly drew
up, and Agnes's conductor, dismounting, came and took
her silently from her saddle, saying briefly, "Come this
way."</p>

<p>Elsie sprang from her seat in a moment, and placed herself
at the side of her child.</p>

<p>"No, good mother," said the man with whom she had
ridden, seizing her powerfully by the shoulders, and turning
her round.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Elsie, fiercely. "Are you
going to keep me from my own child?"</p>

<p>"Patience!" replied the man. "You can't help yourself,
so recommend yourself to God, and no harm shall
come to you."</p>

<p>Agnes looked back at her grandmother.</p>

<p>"Fear not, dear grandmamma," she said, "the blessed
angels will watch over us."</p>

<p>As she spoke, she followed her conductor through long,
damp, mouldering passages, and up flights of stone steps,
and again through other long passages, smelling of mould
and damp, till at last he opened the door of an apartment
from which streamed a light so dazzling to the eyes of
Agnes that at first she could form no distinct conception as
to where she was.</p>

<p>As soon as her eyesight cleared, she found herself in an
apartment which to her simplicity seemed furnished with an
unheard-of luxury. The walls were richly frescoed and
gilded, and from a chandelier of Venetian glass the light fell
upon a foot-cloth of brilliant tapestry which covered the
marble floor. Gilded chairs and couches, covered with the
softest Genoese velvet, invited to repose; while tables inlaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
with choice mosaics stood here and there, sustaining
rare vases, musical instruments, and many of the light,
fanciful ornaments with which, in those days, the halls of
women of condition were graced. At one end of the apartment
was an alcove, where the rich velvet curtains were
looped away with heavy cords and tassels of gold, displaying
a smaller room, where was a bed with hangings of
crimson satin embroidered with gold.</p>

<p>Agnes stood petrified with amazement, and put her hand
to her head, as if to assure herself by the sense of touch
that she was not dreaming, and then, with an impulse of
curious wonder, began examining the apartment. The rich
furniture and the many adornments, though only such as
were common in the daily life of the great at that period,
had for her simple eyes all the marvelousness of the most
incredible illusion. She touched the velvet couches almost
with fear, and passed from object to object in a sort of
maze. When she arrived at the alcove, she thought she
heard a slight rustling within, and then a smothered laugh.
Her heart beat quick as she stopped to listen. There was
a tittering sound, and a movement as if some one were
shaking the curtain, and at last Giulietta stood in the door-way.</p>

<p>For a moment Agnes stood looking at her in utter bewilderment.
Yes, surely it was Giulietta, dressed out in all
the bravery of splendid apparel, her black hair shining and
lustrous, great solid ear-rings of gold shaking in her ears,
and a row of gold coins displayed around her neck.</p>

<p>She broke into a loud laugh at the sight of Agnes's
astonished face.</p>

<p>"So, here you are!" she said. "Well, now, didn't I
tell you so? You see he was in love with you, just as I
said; and if you wouldn't come to him of your own accord,
he must fly off with you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Giulietta!" said Agnes, springing towards her and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
catching her hands, "what does all this mean? and where
have they carried poor grandmamma?"</p>

<p>"Oh, never worry about her! Do you know you are in
high favor here, and any one who belongs to you gets good
quarters? Your grandmother just now is at supper, I
doubt not, with my mother; and a jolly time they will
have of it, gossiping together."</p>

<p>"Your mother here, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, simple, to be sure! I found it so much easier
living here than in the old town, that I sent for her, that
she might have peace in her old age. But how do you
like your room? Were you not astonished to see it so
brave? Know, then, pretty one, that it is all on account
of the good courage of our band. For, you see, the people
there in Rome (we won't say who) had given away all our
captain's lands and palaces and villas to this one and that,
as pleased them; and one pretty little villa in the mountains
not far from here went to a stout old cardinal. What
does a band of our men do, one night, but pounce on old
red-hat and tie him up, while they helped themselves to
what they liked through the house? True, they couldn't
bring house and all; but they brought stores of rich furnishing,
and left him thanking the saints that he was yet
alive. So we arranged your rooms right nobly, thinking
to please our captain when he comes. If you are not
pleased, you will be ungrateful, that's all."</p>

<p>"Giulietta," said Agnes, who had scarcely seemed to
listen to this prattle, so anxious was she to speak of what
lay nearest her heart, "I want to see grandmamma. Can't
you bring her to me?"</p>

<p>"No, my little princess, I can't. Do you know you are
my mistress, now? Well, you are; but there's one that's
master of us both, and he says none must speak with you
till he has seen you."</p>

<p>"And is he here?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
"No, he has been some time gone northward, and has
not returned,&mdash;though we expect him to-night. So compose
yourself, and ask for anything in the world, but to
see your grandmother, and I will show that I am your
humble servant to command."</p>

<p>So saying, Giulietta courtesied archly and laughed, showing
her white, shiny teeth, which looked as bright as
pearls.</p>

<p>Agnes sat down on one of the velvet couches, and leaned
her head on her hand.</p>

<p>"Come, now, let me bring you some supper," said Giulietta.
"What say you to a nice roast fowl and a bottle
of wine?</p>

<p>"How can you speak of such things in the holy time of
Lent?" said Agnes.</p>

<p>"Oh, never you fear about that! Our holy Father Stefano
sets such matters right for any of us in a twinkling,
and especially would he do it for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, but Giulietta, I don't want anything. I couldn't
eat, if I were to try."</p>

<p>"Ta, ta, ta!" said Giulietta, going out. "Wait till
you smell it. I shall be back in a little while."</p>

<p>And she left the room, locking the door after her.</p>

<p>In a few moments she returned, bearing a rich silver
tray, on which was a covered dish that steamed a refreshing
odor, together with a roll of white bread, and a small
glass <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">flacon</i> containing a little choice wine.</p>

<p>By much entreaty and coaxing, Agnes was induced to
partake of the bread, enough to revive her somewhat after
the toils of the day; and then, a little reassured by the
familiar presence of Giulietta, she began to undress, her
former companion officiously assisting her.</p>

<p>"There, now, you are tired, my lady princess," she
said. "I'll unlace your bodice. One of these days your
gowns will be all of silk, and stiff with gold and pearls."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
"Oh, Giulietta," said Agnes, "don't!&mdash;let me,&mdash;I
don't need help."</p>

<p>"Ta, ta, ta!&mdash;you must learn to be waited on," said
Giulietta, persisting. "But, Holy Virgin! what is the
matter here? Oh, Agnes, what <i>are</i> you doing to yourself?"</p>

<p>"It's a penance, Giulietta," said Agnes, her face flushing.</p>

<p>"Well, I should think it was! Father Francesco ought
to be ashamed of himself; he is a real butcher!"</p>

<p>"He does it to save my soul, Giulietta. The cross of
our Lord without will heal a deadly wound within."</p>

<p>In her heart, Giulietta had somewhat of secret reverence
for such austerities, which the whole instruction of her
time and country taught her to regard as especially saintly.
People who live in the senses more than in the world of
reflection feel the force of such outward appeals. Giulietta
made the sign of the cross, and looked grave for several
minutes.</p>

<p>"Poor little dove!" she said at last, "if your sins must
needs be expiated so, what will become of me? It must
be that you will lay up stores of merit with God; for
surely your sins do not need <i>all</i> this. Agnes, you will be
a saint some day, like your namesake at the Convent, I
truly do believe."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, Giulietta! don't talk so! God knows I
wrestle with forbidden thoughts all the while. I am no
saint, but the chief of sinners."</p>

<p>"That's what the saints all say," said Giulietta. "But,
my dear princess, when <i>he</i> comes, he will forbid this; he
is lordly, and will not suffer his little <span class="locked">wife"&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Giulietta, don't speak so,&mdash;I cannot hear it,&mdash;I must
not be his wife,&mdash;I am vowed to be the spouse of the
Lord."</p>

<p>"And yet you love our handsome prince," said Giulietta;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
"and there is the great sin you are breaking your little
heart about. Well, now, it's all of that dry, sour old
Father Francesco. I never could abide him,&mdash;he made
such dismal pother about sin; old Father Girolamo was
worth a dozen of him. If you would just see our good
Father Stefano, now, he would set your mind at ease about
your vows in a twinkling; and you must needs get them
loosed, for our captain is born to command, and when
princes stoop to us peasant-girls, it isn't for us to say nay.
It's being good as Saint Michael himself for him to think
of you only in the holy way of marriage. I'll warrant me,
there's many a lord cardinal at Rome that isn't so good;
and as to princes, he is one of a thousand, a most holy and
religious knight, or he would do as others do when they
have the power."</p>

<p>Agnes, confused and agitated, turned away, and, as if
seeking refuge, laid her down in the bed, looking timidly
up at the unwonted splendor,&mdash;and then, hiding her face
in the pillow, began repeating a prayer.</p>

<p>Giulietta sat by her a moment, till she felt, from the
relaxing of the little hand, that the reaction of fatigue and
intense excitement was beginning to take place. Nature
would assert her rights, and the heavy curtain of sleep fell
on the weary little head. Quietly extinguishing the lights,
Giulietta left the room, locking the door.</p>

<hr />

<h2 class="vspace2"><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV</a><br />

<span class="smaller">THE CRISIS</span></h2>

<p>Agnes was so entirely exhausted with bodily fatigue
and mental agitation that she slept soundly till awakened
by the beams of the morning sun. Her first glance up at
the gold-embroidered curtains of her bed occasioned a bewildered
surprise;&mdash;she raised herself and looked around,
slowly recovering her consciousness and the memory of the
strange event which had placed her where she was. She
rose hastily and went to the window to look out. This
window was in a kind of circular tower projecting from
the side of the building, such as one often sees in old Norman
architecture;&mdash;it overhung not only a wall of dizzy
height, but a precipice with a sheer descent of some thousand
feet; and far below, spread out like a map in the
distance, lay a prospect of enchanting richness. The eye
might wander over orchards of silvery olives, plantations
with their rows of mulberry-trees supporting the vines,
now in the first tender spring green, scarlet fields of clover,
and patches where the young corn was just showing its
waving blades above the brown soil. Here and there rose
tufts of stone-pines with their dark umbrella-tops towering
above all other foliage, while far off in the blue distance a
silvery belt of glittering spangles showed where the sea
closed in the horizon-line. So high was the perch, so distant
and dreamy the prospect, that Agnes felt a sensation of giddiness,
as if she were suspended over it in the air,&mdash;and
turned away from the window, to look again at what seemed
to her the surprising and unheard-of splendors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
apartment. There lay her simple peasant garb on the rich
velvet couch,&mdash;a strange sight in the midst of so much
luxury. Having dressed herself, she sat down, and, covering
her face with her hands, tried to reflect calmly on the
position in which she was placed.</p>

<p>With the education she had received, she could look on
this strange interruption of her pilgrimage only as a special
assault upon her faith, instigated by those evil spirits that
are ever setting themselves in conflict with the just. Such
trials had befallen saints of whom she had read. They
had been assailed by visions of worldly ease and luxury
suddenly presented before them, for which they were
tempted to deny their faith and sell their souls. Was it
not, perhaps, as a punishment for having admitted the love
of an excommunicated heretic into her heart, that this sore
trial had been permitted to come upon her? And if she
should fail? She shuddered, when she recalled the severe
and terrible manner in which Father Francesco had warned
her against yielding to the solicitations of an earthly love.
To her it seemed as if that holy man must have been
inspired with a prophetic foresight of her present position,
and warned her against it. Those awful words came
burning into her mind as when they seemed to issue like
the voice of a spirit from the depths of the confessional:
"<i>If ever you should yield to his love, and turn back
from this heavenly marriage to follow him, you will accomplish
his damnation and your own.</i>"</p>

<p>Agnes trembled in an agony of real belief, and with a
vivid terror of the world to come such as belonged to the
almost physical certainty with which the religious teaching
of her time presented it to the popular mind. Was she,
indeed, the cause of such awful danger to his soul? Might
a false step now, a faltering human weakness, indeed
plunge that soul, so dear, into a fiery abyss without bottom
or shore? Should she forever hear his shrieks of torture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
and despair, his curses on the hour he had first known her?
Her very blood curdled, her nerves froze, as she thought of
it, and she threw herself on her knees and prayed with an
anguish that brought the sweat in beaded drops to her forehead,&mdash;strange
dew for so frail a lily!&mdash;and her prayer
rose above all intercession of saints, above the seat even of
the Virgin Mother herself, to the heart of her Redeemer,
to Him who some divine instinct told her was alone mighty
to save. We of the present day may look on her distress
as unreal, as the result of a misguided sense of religious
obligation; but the great Hearer of Prayer regards each
heart in its own scope of vision, and helps not less the
mistaken than the enlightened distress. And for that
matter, who is enlightened? who carries to God's throne a
trouble or a temptation in which there is not somewhere
a misconception or a mistake?</p>

<p>And so it came to pass. Agnes rose from prayer with
an experience which has been common to the members of
the True Invisible Church, whether Catholic, Greek, or
Protestant. "In the day when I cried Thou answeredst
me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul."
She had that vivid sense of the sustaining presence and
sympathy of an Almighty Saviour which is the substance
of which all religious forms and appliances are the shadows;
her soul was stayed on God, and was at peace, as truly as
if she had been the veriest Puritan maiden that ever worshiped
in a New England meeting-house. She felt a calm
superiority to all things earthly,&mdash;a profound reliance on
that invisible aid which comes from God alone.</p>

<p>She was standing at her window, deep in thought, when
Giulietta entered, fresh and blooming, bearing the breakfast-tray.</p>

<p>"Come, my little princess, here I am," she said, "with
your breakfast! How do you find yourself, this morning?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
Agnes came towards her.</p>

<p>"Bless us, how grave we are!" said Giulietta. "What
has come over us?"</p>

<p>"Giulietta, have you seen poor grandmamma this morning?"</p>

<p>"Poor grandmamma!" said Giulietta, mimicking the sad
tone in which Agnes spoke, "to be sure I have. I left
her making a hearty breakfast. So fall to, and do the
same, for you don't know who may come to see you this
morning."</p>

<p>"Giulietta, is he here?"</p>

<p>"He!" said Giulietta, laughing. "Do hear the little
bird! It begins to chirp already! No, he is not here
yet; but Pietro says he will come soon, and Pietro knows
all his movements."</p>

<p>"Pietro is your husband?" said Agnes, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure,&mdash;and a pretty good one, too, as men
go," said Giulietta. "They are sorry bargains, the best of
them. But you'll get a prize, if you play your cards well.
Do you know that the King of Naples and the King of
France have both sent messages to our captain? Our men
hold all the passes between Rome and Naples, and so every
one sees the sense of gaining our captain's favor. But eat
your breakfast, little one, while I go and see to Pietro and
the men."</p>

<p>So saying, she bustled out of the room, locking the door
behind her.</p>

<p>Agnes took a little bread and water, resolved to fast and
pray, as the only defense against the danger in which she
stood.</p>

<p>After breakfasting, she retired into the inner room, and
opening the window, sat down and looked out on the prospect,
and then, in a low voice, began singing a hymn of
Savonarola's, which had been taught her by her uncle. It
was entitled "Christ's Call to the Soul." The words were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
conceived in that tender spirit of mystical devotion which
characterizes all this class of productions.</p>

<p>While Agnes was singing, the door of the outer room
was slowly opened, and Agostino Sarelli entered. He had
just returned from Florence, having ridden day and night
to meet her whom he expected to find within the walls of
his fastness.</p>

<p>He entered so softly that Agnes did not hear his approach,
and he stood listening to her singing. He had
come back with his mind burning with indignation against
the Pope and the whole hierarchy then ruling in Rome;
but conversation with Father Antonio and the scenes he
had witnessed at San Marco had converted the blind sense
of personal wrong into a fixed principle of moral indignation
and opposition. He no longer found himself checked
by the pleading of his early religious recollections; for now
he had a leader who realized in his own person all his conceptions
of those primitive apostles and holy bishops who
first fed the flock of the Lord in Italy. He had heard
from his lips the fearless declaration, "If Rome is against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
me, know that it is not contrary to me, but to Christ, and
its controversy is with God: doubt not that God will conquer;"
and he embraced the cause with all the enthusiasm
of patriotism and knighthood. In his view, the most holy
place of his religion had been taken by a robber, who
reigned in the name of Christ only to disgrace it; and he
felt called to pledge his sword, his life, his knightly honor
to do battle against him. He had urged his uncle in Milan
to make interest for the cause of Savonarola with the King
of France; and his uncle, with that crafty diplomacy which
in those days formed the staple of what was called statesmanship,
had seemed to listen favorably to his views, intending,
however, no more by his apparent assent than to
withdraw his nephew from the dangers in which he stood
in Italy, and bring him under his own influence and guardianship
in the court of France. But the wily diplomate
had sent Agostino Sarelli from his presence with the highest
possible expectations of his influence both with the
King of France and the Emperor of Germany in the present
religious crisis in Italy.</p>

<p>And now the time was come, Agostino thought, to break
the spell under which Agnes was held,&mdash;to show her the
true character of the men whom she was beholding through
a mist of veneration arising entirely from the dewy freshness
of ignorant innocence. All the way home from Florence
he had urged his horse onward, burning to meet her,
to tell her all that he knew and felt, to claim her as his
own, and to take her into the sphere of light and liberty
in which he himself moved. He did not doubt his power,
when she should once be where he could speak with her
freely, without fear of interruption. Hers was a soul too
good and pure, he said, to be kept in chains of slavish ignorance
any longer. When she ceased singing, he spoke from
the outer apartment, "Agnes!"</p>

<p>The name was uttered in the softest tone, but it sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
the blood to her heart, as if it were the summons of doom.
Everything seemed to swim before her, and grow dark for
a moment; but by a strong effort she lifted her heart in
prayer, and, rising, came towards him.</p>

<p>Agostino had figured her to himself in all that soft and
sacred innocence and freshness of bloom in which he had
left her, a fair angel child, looking through sad, innocent
eyes on a life whose sins and sorrows, and deeper loves and
hates, she scarcely comprehended,&mdash;one that he might fold
in his arms with protecting tenderness, while he gently
reasoned with her fears and prejudices; but the figure that
stood there in the curtained arch, with its solemn, calm,
transparent paleness of face, its large, intense dark eyes,
now vivid with some mysterious and concentrated resolve,
struck a strange chill over him. Was it Agnes or a disembodied
spirit that stood before him? For a few moments
there fell such a pause between them as the intensity
of some unexpressed feeling often brings with it, and
which seems like a spell.</p>

<p>"Agnes! Agnes! is it you?" at last said the knight, in
a low, hesitating tone. "Oh, my love, what has changed
you so? Speak!&mdash;do speak! Are you angry with me?
Are you angry that I brought you here?"</p>

<p>"My Lord, I am not angry," said Agnes, speaking in a
cold, sad tone; "but you have committed a great sin in
turning aside those vowed to a holy pilgrimage, and you
tempt me to sin by this conversation, which ought not to
be between us."</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Agostino. "You would not see me
at Sorrento. I sought to warn you of the dangers of this
pilgrimage,&mdash;to tell you that Rome is not what you think
it is,&mdash;that it is not the seat of Christ, but a foul cage of
unclean birds, a den of wickedness,&mdash;that he they call
Pope is a vile <span class="locked">impostor"&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"My Lord," said Agnes, speaking with a touch of something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
even commanding in her tone, "you have me at advantage,
it is true, but you ought not to use it in trying to
ruin my soul by blaspheming holy things." And then she
added, in a tone of indescribable sadness, "Alas, that so
noble and beautiful a soul should be in rebellion against
the only True Church! Have you forgotten that good
mother you spoke of? What must she feel to know that
her son is an infidel!"</p>

<p>"I am not an infidel, Agnes; I am a true knight of our
Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and a believer in the One
True, Holy Church."</p>

<p>"How can that be?" said Agnes. "Ah, seek not to
deceive me! My Lord, such a poor little girl as I am is
not worth the pains."</p>

<p>"By the Holy Mother, Agnes, by the Holy Cross, I do
not seek to deceive you! I speak on my honor as a knight
and gentleman. I love you truly and honorably, and seek
you among all women as my spotless wife, and would I lie
to <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>"My Lord, you have spoken words which it is a sin for
me to hear, a peril to your soul to say; and if you had
not, you must not seek me as a wife. Holy vows are upon
me. I must be the wife of no man here; it is a sin even
to think of it."</p>

<p>"Impossible, Agnes!" said Agostino, with a start.
"You have not taken the veil already? If you <span class="locked">had"&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"No, my Lord, I have not. I have only promised and
vowed in my heart to do so when the Lord shall open the
way."</p>

<p>"But such vows, dear Agnes, are often dispensed; they
may be loosed by the priest. Now hear me,&mdash;only hear
me. I believe as your uncle believes,&mdash;your good, pious
uncle, whom you love so much. I have taken the sacrament
from his hand; he has blessed me as a son. I believe
as Jerome Savonarola believes. He it is, that holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
prophet, who has proclaimed this Pope and his crew to be
vile usurpers, reigning in the name of Christ."</p>

<p>"My Lord! my Lord! I must not hear more! I must
not,&mdash;I cannot,&mdash;I will not!" said Agnes, becoming violently
agitated, as she found herself listening with interest
to the pleadings of her lover.</p>

<p>"Oh, Agnes, what has turned your heart against me?
I thought you promised to love me a little?"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush! hush! don't plead with me!" she said,
with a wild, affrighted look.</p>

<p>He sought to come towards her, and she sprang forward
and threw herself at his feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, my Lord, for mercy's sake let me go! Let us go
on our way! We will pray for you always,&mdash;yes, always!"
And she looked up at him in an agony of earnestness.</p>

<p>"Am I so hateful to you, then, Agnes?"</p>

<p>"Hateful? Oh, no, no! God knows you are&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;yes,
I love you too well, and you have too much power
over me; but, oh, do not use it! If I hear you talk I shall
yield,&mdash;I surely shall, and we shall be lost, both of us!
Oh, my God! I shall be the means of your damnation!"</p>

<p>"Agnes!"</p>

<p>"It is true! it is true! Oh, do not talk to me, but
promise me, promise me, or I shall die! Have pity on
me! have pity on yourself!"</p>

<p>In the agony of her feelings her voice became almost
a shriek, and her wild, affrighted face had a deadly pallor;
she looked like one in a death-agony. Agostino was
alarmed, and hastened to soothe her, by promising whatever
she required:</p>

<p>"Agnes, dear Agnes, I submit; only be calm. I promise
anything,&mdash;anything in the wide world you can ask."</p>

<p>"Will you let me go?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And will you let my poor grandmamma go with me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you will not talk with me any more?"</p>

<p>"Not if you do not wish it. And now," he said, "that
I have submitted to all these hard conditions, will you suffer
me to raise you?"</p>

<p>He took her hands and lifted her up; they were cold,
and she was trembling and shivering. He held them a
moment; she tried to withdraw them, and he let them go.</p>

<p>"Farewell, Agnes!" he said. "I am going."</p>

<p>She raised both her hands and pressed the sharp cross
to her bosom, but made no answer.</p>

<p>"I yield to your will," he continued. "Immediately
when I leave you your grandmother will come to you, and
the attendants who brought you here will conduct you to
the high-road. For me, since it is your will, I part here.
Farewell, Agnes!"</p>

<p>He held out his hand, but she stood as before, pale and
silent, with her hands clasped on her breast.</p>

<p>"Do your vows forbid even a farewell to a poor, humble
friend?" said the knight, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"I cannot," said Agnes, speaking at broken intervals, in
a suffocating voice,&mdash;"for <i>your</i> sake I cannot! I bear
this pain for you,&mdash;for <i>you</i>! Oh, repent, and meet me
in heaven!"</p>

<p>She gave him her hand; he kneeled and kissed it,
pressed it to his forehead, then rose and left the room.</p>

<p>For a moment after the departure of the cavalier, Agnes
felt a bitter pang,&mdash;the pain which one feels on first realizing
that a dear friend is lost forever; and then, rousing
herself with a start and a sigh, she hurried into the inner
room and threw herself on her knees, giving thanks that
the dreadful trial was past, and that she had not been left
to fail.</p>

<p>In a few moments she heard the voice of her grandmother
in the outer apartment, and the old wrinkled creature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
clasped her grandchild in her arms, and wept with a passionate
abandonment of fondness, calling her by every
tender and endearing name which mothers give to their
infants.</p>

<p>"After all," said Elsie, "these are not such bad people,
and I have been right well entertained among them. They
are of ourselves,&mdash;they do not prey on the poor, but only
on our enemies, the princes and nobles, who look on us as
sheep to be shorn and slaughtered for their wearing and
eating. These men are none such, but pitiful to poor
peasants and old widows, whom they feed and clothe out
of the spoils of the rich. As to their captain,&mdash;would
you believe it?&mdash;he is the same handsome gentleman who
once gave you a ring,&mdash;you may have forgotten him, as
you never think of such things, but I knew him in a moment,&mdash;and
such a religious man, that no sooner did he
find that we were pilgrims on a holy errand, than he gave
orders to have us set free with all honor, and a band of the
best of them to escort us through the mountains; and the
people of the town are all moved to do us reverence, and
coming with garlands and flowers to wish us well and ask
our prayers. So let us set forth immediately."</p>

<p>Agnes followed her grandmother through the long passages
and down the dark, mouldy stairway to the court-yard,
where two horses were standing caparisoned for them.
A troop of men in high peaked hats, cloaked and plumed,
were preparing also to mount, while a throng of women and
children stood pressing around. When Agnes appeared,
enthusiastic cries were heard: "<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Viva Jesù!</i>" "<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Viva
Maria!</i>" "<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Viva! viva Jesù! nostro Re!</i>" and showers
of myrtle-branches and garlands fell around. "Pray for
us!" "Pray for us, holy pilgrims!" was uttered eagerly
by one and another. Mothers held up their children;
and beggars and cripples, aged and sick,&mdash;never absent in
an Italian town,&mdash;joined with loud cries in the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
enthusiasm. Agnes stood amid it all, pale and serene,
with that elevated expression of heavenly calm on her features
which is often the clear shining of the soul after the
wrench and torture of some great interior conflict. She
felt that the last earthly chain was broken, and that now
she belonged to Heaven alone. She scarcely saw or heard
what was around her, wrapt in the calm of inward prayer.</p>

<p>"Look at her! she is beautiful as the Madonna!" said
one and another. "She is divine as Santa Catarina!" said
others. "She might have been the wife of our chief, who
is a nobleman of the oldest blood, but she chose to be the
bride of the Lord," said others: for Giulietta, with a woman's
love of romancing, had not failed to make the most
among her companions of the love-adventures of Agnes.</p>

<p>Agnes meanwhile was seated on her palfrey, and the
whole train passed out of the court-yard into the dim, narrow
street,&mdash;men, women, and children following. On
reaching the public square, they halted a moment by the
side of the antique fountain to water their horses. The
groups that surrounded it at this time were such as a
painter would have delighted to copy. The women and
girls of this obscure mountain-town had all that peculiar
beauty of form and attitude which appears in the studies of
the antique; and as they poised on their heads their copper
water-jars of the old Etruscan pattern, they seemed as if
they might be statues of golden bronze, had not the warm
tints of their complexion, the brilliancy of their large eyes,
and the bright picturesque colors of their attire given the
richness of painting to their classic outlines. Then, too,
the men, with their finely-moulded limbs, their figures so
straight and strong and elastic, their graceful attitudes,
and their well-fitting, showy costumes, formed a no less
imposing feature in the scene. Among them all sat Agnes
waiting on her palfrey, seeming scarcely conscious of the
enthusiasm which surrounded her. Some admiring friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
had placed in her hand a large bough of blossoming hawthorn,
which she held unconsciously, as, with a sort of
childlike simplicity, she turned from right to left, to make
reply to the request for prayers, or to return thanks for the
offered benediction of some one in the crowd.</p>

<p>When all the preparations were at last finished, the procession
of mounted horsemen, with a confused gathering of
the population, passed down the streets to the gates of the
city, and as they passed they sang the words of the Crusaders'
Hymn, which had fluttered back into the traditionary
memory of Europe from the knights going to redeem the
Holy Sepulchre.</p>

<p>They were singing the second verse, as, emerging from
the dark old gateway of the town, all the distant landscape
of silvery olive-orchards, crimson clover-fields, blossoming
almond-trees, fig-trees, and grapevines, just in the tender
green of spring, burst upon their view. Agnes felt a kind
of inspiration. From the high mountain elevation she
could discern the far-off brightness of the sea,&mdash;all between
one vision of beauty,&mdash;and the religious enthusiasm which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
possessed all around her had in her eye all the value of the
most solid and reasonable faith. With us, who may look
on it from a colder and more distant point of view, doubts
may be suggested whether this <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">naïve</i> impressibility to religious
influences, this simple, whole-hearted abandonment
to their expression, had any real practical value. The fact
that any or all of the actors might before night rob or stab
or lie quite as freely as if it had not occurred may well
give reason for such a question. Be this as it may, the
phenomenon is not confined to Italy or the religion of the
Middle Ages, but exhibits itself in many a prayer-meeting
and camp-meeting of modern days. For our own part, we
hold it better to have even transient upliftings of the nobler
and more devout element of man's nature than never
to have any at all, and that he who goes on in worldly and
sordid courses, without ever a spark of religious enthusiasm
or a throb of aspiration, is less of a man than he who sometimes
soars heavenward, though his wings be weak and he
fall again.</p>

<p>In all this scene Agostino Sarelli took no part. He had
simply given orders for the safe-conduct of Agnes, and
then retired to his own room. From a window, however,
he watched the procession as it passed through the gates of
the city, and his resolution was immediately taken to proceed
at once by a secret path to the place where the pilgrims
should emerge upon the high-road.</p>

<p>He had been induced to allow the departure of Agnes
from seeing the utter hopelessness by any argument or persuasion
of removing a barrier that was so vitally interwoven
with the most sensitive religious nerves of her being. He
saw in her terrified looks, in the deadly paleness of her
face, how real and unaffected was the anguish which his
words gave her; he saw that the very consciousness of her
own love to him produced a sense of weakness which made
her shrink in utter terror from his arguments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
"There is no remedy," he said, "but to let her go to
Rome and see with her own eyes how utterly false and
vain is the vision which she draws from the purity of her
own believing soul. What Christian would not wish that
these fair dreams had any earthly reality? But this gentle
dove must not be left unprotected to fly into that foul,
unclean cage of vultures and harpies. Deadly as the peril
may be to me to breathe the air of Rome, I will be around
her invisibly to watch over her."</p>

<span class="smaller">ROME</span></h2>

<p>A vision rises upon us from the land of shadows. We
see a wide plain, miles and miles in extent, rolling in soft
billows of green, and girded on all sides by blue mountains,
whose silver crests gleaming in the setting sunlight
tell that the winter yet lingers on their tops, though spring
has decked all the plain. So silent, so lonely, so fair is
this waving expanse with its guardian mountains, it might
be some wild solitude, an American prairie or Asiatic
steppe, but that in the midst thereof, on some billows of
rolling land, we discern a city, sombre, quaint, and old,&mdash;a
city of dreams and mysteries,&mdash;a city of the living and
the dead. And this is Rome,&mdash;weird, wonderful, ancient,
mighty Rome,&mdash;mighty once by physical force and
grandeur, mightier now in physical decadence and weakness
by the spell of a potent moral enchantment.</p>

<p>As the sun is moving westward, the whole air around
becomes flooded with a luminousness which seems to transfuse
itself with pervading presence through every part of
the city, and make all its ruinous and mossy age bright
and living. The air shivers with the silver vibrations of
hundreds of bells, and the evening glory goes up and
down, soft-footed and angelic, transfiguring all things.
The broken columns of the Forum seem to swim in golden
mist, and luminous floods fill the Coliseum as it stands
with its thousand arches looking out into the city like so
many sightless eye-holes in the skull of the past. The
tender light pours up streets dank and ill-paved,&mdash;into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
noisome and cavernous dens called houses, where the
peasantry of to-day vegetate in contented subservience.
It illuminates many a dingy court-yard, where the moss is
green on the walls, and gurgling fountains fall into quaint
old sculptured basins. It lights up the gorgeous palaces
of Rome's modern princes, built with stones wrenched from
ancient ruins. It streams through a wilderness of churches,
each with its tolling prayer-bell, and steals through painted
windows into the dazzling confusion of pictured and gilded
glories that glitter and gleam from roof and wall within.
And it goes, too, across the Tiber, up the filthy and noisome
Ghetto, where, hemmed in by ghostly superstition,
the sons of Israel are growing up without vital day, like
wan white plants in cellars; and the black mournful obelisks
of the cypresses in the villas around, it touches with
a solemn glory. The castle of St. Angelo looks like a great
translucent, luminous orb, and the statues of saints and
apostles on the top of St. John Lateran glow as if made of
living fire, and seem to stretch out glorified hands of welcome
to the pilgrims that are approaching the Holy City
across the soft, palpitating sea of green that lies stretched
like a misty veil around it.</p>

<p>Then, as now, Rome was an enchantress of mighty and
wonderful power, with her damp, and mud, and mould,
her ill-fed, ill-housed populace, her ruins of old glory rising
dim and ghostly amid her palaces of to-day. With all
her awful secrets of rapine, cruelty, ambition, injustice,&mdash;with
her foul orgies of unnatural crime,&mdash;with the very
corruption of the old buried Roman Empire steaming up as
from a charnel-house, and permeating all modern life with
its effluvium of deadly uncleanness,&mdash;still Rome had that
strange, bewildering charm of melancholy grandeur and
glory which made all hearts cleave to her, and eyes and
feet turn longingly towards her from the ends of the earth.
Great souls and pious yearned for her as for a mother, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
could not be quieted till they had kissed the dust of her
streets. There they fondly thought was rest to be found,&mdash;that
rest which through all weary life ever recedes like
the mirage of the desert; there sins were to be shriven
which no common priest might forgive, and heavy burdens
unbound from the conscience by an infallible wisdom;
there was to be revealed to the praying soul the substance
of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. Even
the mighty spirit of Luther yearned for the breast of this
great unknown mother, and came humbly thither to seek
the repose which he found afterwards in Jesus.</p>

<p>At this golden twilight-hour along the Appian Way
come the pilgrims of our story with prayers and tears of
thankfulness. Agnes looks forward and sees the saintly
forms on St. John Lateran standing in a cloud of golden
light and stretching out protecting hands to bless her.</p>

<p>"See, see, grandmother!" she exclaimed, "yonder is
our Father's house, and all the saints beckon us home!
Glory be to God, who hath brought us hither!"</p>

<p>Within the church the evening-service is going on, and
the soft glory streaming in reveals that dizzying confusion
of riches and brightness with which the sensuous and color-loving
Italian delights to encircle the shrine of the Heavenly
Majesty. Pictured angels in cloudy wreaths smile
down from the gold-fretted roofs and over the round, graceful
arches; and the floor seems like a translucent sea of
precious marbles and gems fused into solid brightness, and
reflecting in long gleams and streaks dim intimations of
the sculptured and gilded glories above. Altar and shrine
are now veiled in that rich violet hue which the Church
has chosen for its mourning color; and violet vestments,
taking the place of the gorgeous robes of the ecclesiastics,
tell the approach of that holy week of sadness when all
Christendom falls in penitence at the feet of that Almighty
Love once sorrowful and slain for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
The long-drawn aisles are now full to overflowing with
that weird chanting which one hears nowhere but in Rome
at this solemn season. Those voices, neither of men nor
women, have a wild, morbid energy which seems to search
every fibre of the nervous system, and, instead of soothing
or calming, to awaken strange yearning agonies of pain,
ghostly unquiet longings, and endless feverish, unrestful
cravings. The sounds now swell and flood the church as
with a rushing torrent of wailing and clamorous supplication,&mdash;now
recede and moan themselves away to silence
in far-distant aisles, like the last faint sigh of discouragement
and despair. Anon they burst out from the room,
they drop from arches and pictures, they rise like steam
from the glassy pavement, and, meeting, mingle in wavering
clamors of lamentation and shrieks of anguish. One
might fancy lost souls from out the infinite and dreary
abysses of utter separation from God might thus wearily
and aimlessly moan and wail, breaking into agonized tumults
of desire, and trembling back into exhaustions of
despair. Such music brings only throbbings and yearnings,
but no peace; and yonder, on the glassy floor, at the
foot of a crucifix, a poor mortal lies sobbing and quivering
under its pitiless power, as if it had wrenched every tenderest
nerve of memory, and torn open every half-healed
wound of the soul.</p>

<p>When the chanting ceases, he rises slow and tottering,
and we see in the wan face turning towards the dim light
the well-remembered features of Father Francesco. Driven
to despair by the wild, ungovernable force of his unfortunate
love, weary of striving, overborne with a hopeless and
continually accumulating load of guilt, he had come to
Rome to lay down at the feet of heavenly wisdom the burden
which he can no longer bear alone; and rising now, he
totters to a confessional where sits a holy cardinal to whom
has been deputed the office to hear and judge those sins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
which no subordinate power in the Church is competent to
absolve.</p>

<p>Father Francesco kneels down with a despairing, confiding
movement, such as one makes, when, after a long
struggle of anguish, one has found a refuge; and the
churchman within inclining his ear to the grating, the confession
begins.</p>

<p>Could we only be clairvoyant, it would be worth our
while to note the difference between the two faces, separated
only by the thin grating of the confessional, but belonging
to souls whom an abyss wide as eternity must forever
divide from any common ground of understanding.</p>

<p>On the one side, with ear close to the grate, is a round,
smoothly developed Italian head, with that rather tumid
outline of features which one often sees in a Roman in
middle life, when easy living and habits of sensual indulgence
begin to reveal their signs in the countenance, and to
broaden and confuse the clear-cut, statuesque lines of early
youth. Evidently, that is the head of an easy-going, pleasure-loving
man, who has waxed warm with good living,
and performs the duties of his office with an unctuous grace
as something becoming and decorous to be gone through
with. Evidently he is puzzled and half-contemptuous at
the revelations which come through the grating in hoarse
whispers from those thin, trembling lips. The other man,
who speaks with the sweat of anguish beaded on his brow,
with a mortal pallor on his thin, worn cheeks, is putting
questions to the celestial guide within which seem to that
guide the ravings of a crazed lunatic; and yet there is a
deadly, despairing earnestness in the appeal that makes an
indistinct knocking at the door of his heart, for the man is
born of woman, and can feel that somehow or other these
are the words of a mighty agony.</p>

<p>He addresses him some words of commonplace ghostly
comfort, and gives a plenary absolution. The Capuchin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
monk rises up and stands meekly wiping the sweat from
his brow, the churchman leaves his box, and they meet
face to face, when each starts, seeing in the other the apparition
of a once well-known countenance.</p>

<p>"What! Lorenzo Sforza!" said the churchman. "Who
would have thought it. Don't you remember me?"</p>

<p>"Not Lorenzo Sforza," said the other, a hectic brilliancy
flushing his pale cheek; "that name is buried in the tomb
of his fathers; he you speak to knows it no more. The
unworthy Brother Francesco, deserving nothing of God or
man, is before you."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, come!" said the other, grasping his hand
in spite of his resistance; "that is all proper enough in its
place; but between friends, you know, what's the use?
It's lucky we have you here now; we want one of your
family to send on a mission to Florence, and talk a little
reason into the citizens and the Signoria. Come right
away with me to the Pope."</p>

<p>"Brother, in God's name let me go! I have no mission
to the great of this world; and I cannot remember or
be called by the name of other days, or salute kinsman or
acquaintance after the flesh, without a breach of vows."</p>

<p>"Poh, poh! you are nervous, dyspeptic; you don't understand
things. Don't you see you are where vows can
be bound and loosed? Come along, and let us wake you
out of this nightmare. Such a pother about a pretty
peasant-girl! One of your rank and taste, too! I warrant
me the little sinner practiced on you at the confessional. I
know their ways, the whole of them; but you mourn over
it in a way that is perfectly incomprehensible. If you
had tripped a little,&mdash;paid a compliment, or taken a liberty
or two,&mdash;it would have been only natural; but this
desperation, when you have resisted like Saint Anthony
himself, shows your nerves are out of order and you need
change."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
"For God's sake, brother, tempt me not!" said Father
Francesco, wrenching himself away, with such a haggard
and insane vehemence as quite to discompose the churchman;
and drawing his cowl over his face, he glided swiftly
down a side-aisle and out the door.</p>

<p>The churchman was too easy-going to risk the fatigue of
a scuffle with a man whom he considered as a monomaniac;
but he stepped smoothly and stealthily after him and
watched him go out.</p>

<p>"Look you," he said to a servant in violet livery who
was waiting by the door, "follow yonder Capuchin and
bring me word where he abides. He may be cracked," he
said to himself; "but, after all, one of his blood may be
worth mending, and do us good service either in Florence
or Milan. We must have him transferred to some convent
here, where we can lay hands on him readily, if we want
him."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Father Francesco wends his way through
many a dark and dingy street to an ancient Capuchin convent,
where he finds brotherly admission. Weary and despairing
is he beyond all earthly despair, for the very altar
of his God seems to have failed him. He asked for bread,
and has got a stone,&mdash;he asked a fish, and has got a scorpion.
Again and again the worldly, almost scoffing, tone
of the superior to whom he has been confessing sounds like
the hiss of a serpent in his ear.</p>

<p>But he is sent for in haste to visit the bedside of the
Prior, who has long been sick and failing, and who gladly
embraces this opportunity to make his last confession to a
man of such reputed sanctity in his order as Father Francesco.
For the acute Father Johannes, casting about for
various means to empty the Superior's chair at Sorrento,
for his own benefit, and despairing of any occasion of slanderous
accusation, had taken the other tack of writing to
Rome extravagant laudations of such feats of penance and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
saintship in his Superior as in the view of all the brothers
required that such a light should no more be hidden in an
obscure province, but be set on a Roman candlestick, where
it might give light to the faithful in all parts of the world.
Thus two currents of worldly intrigue were uniting to push
an unworldly man to a higher dignity than he either
sought or desired.</p>

<p>When a man has a sensitive or sore spot in his heart,
from the pain of which he would gladly flee to the ends of
the earth, it is marvelous what coincidences of events will
be found to press upon it wherever he may go. Singularly
enough, one of the first items in the confession of the
Capuchin Superior related to Agnes, and his story was in
substance as follows. In his youth he had been induced by
the persuasions of the young son of a great and powerful
family to unite him in the holy sacrament of marriage with
a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">protégée</i> of his mother's; but the marriage being detected,
it was disavowed by the young nobleman, and the
girl and her mother chased out ignominiously, so that she
died in great misery. For his complicity in this sin the
conscience of the monk had often troubled him, and he had
kept track of the child she left, thinking perhaps some day
to make reparation by declaring the true marriage of her
mother. That the residence of this young girl had been
at Sorrento, where she had been living quite retired, under
the charge of her old grandmother,&mdash;and here the dying
man made inquiry if Father Francesco was acquainted with
any young person answering to the description which he
gave.</p>

<p>Father Francesco had no difficulty in recognizing the
person,&mdash;and assured the dying penitent, that, in all human
probability, she was at this moment in Rome. The
monk then certified upon the holy cross to the true marriage
of her mother, and besought Father Francesco to
make the same known to one of the kindred whom he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
named. He further informed him, that this family, having
fallen under the displeasure of the Pope and his son, Cæsar
Borgia, had been banished from the city, and their property
confiscated, so that there was none of them to be found
thereabouts except an aged widowed sister of the young
man, who, having married into a family in favor with the
Pope, was allowed to retain her possessions, and now
resided in a villa near Rome, where she lived retired,
devoting her whole life to works of piety. The old man
therefore conjured Father Francesco to lose no time in making
this religious lady understand the existence of so near
a kinswoman, and take her under her protection. Thus
strangely did Father Francesco find himself obliged to take
up that enchanted thread which had led him into labyrinths
so fatal to his peace.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SAINT'S REST</span></h2>

<p>Agnes entered the city of Rome in a trance of enthusiastic
emotion, almost such as one might imagine in a soul
entering the heavenly Jerusalem above. To her exalted
ideas she was approaching not only the ground hallowed
by the blood of apostles and martyrs, not merely the tombs
of the faithful, but the visible "general assembly and
church of the first-born which are written in heaven."
Here reigned the appointed representative of Jesus,&mdash;and
she imagined a benignant image of a prince clothed with
honor and splendor, who was yet the righter of all wrongs,
the redresser of all injuries, the friend and succorer of the
poor and needy; and she was firm in a secret purpose to
go to this great and benignant father, and on her knees
entreat him to forgive the sins of her lover, and remove
the excommunication that threatened at every moment his
eternal salvation. For she trembled to think of it,&mdash;a
sudden accident, a thrust of a dagger, a fall from his horse,
might put him forever beyond the pale of repentance,&mdash;he
might die unforgiven, and sink to eternal pain.</p>

<p>If any should wonder that a Christian soul could preserve
within itself an image so ignorantly fair, in such an
age, when the worldliness and corruption in the Papal chair
were obtruded by a thousand incidental manifestations, and
were alluded to in all the calculations of simple common
people, who looked at facts with a mere view to the guidance
of their daily conduct, it is necessary to remember
the nature of Agnes's religious training, and the absolute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
renunciation of all individual reasoning which from infancy
had been laid down before her as the first and indispensable
prerequisite of spiritual progress. To believe,&mdash;to believe
utterly and blindly,&mdash;not only without evidence, but
against evidence,&mdash;to reject the testimony even of her
senses, when set against the simple affirmation of her superiors,&mdash;had
been the beginning, middle, and end of her
religious instruction. When a doubt assailed her mind on
any point, she had been taught to retire within herself and
repeat a prayer; and in this way her mental eye had formed
the habit of closing to anything that might shake her faith
as quickly as the physical eye closes at a threatened blow.
Then, as she was of a poetic and ideal nature, entirely differing
from the mass of those with whom she associated,
she had formed that habit of abstraction and mental reverie
which prevented her hearing or perceiving the true sense
of a great deal that went on around her. The conversations
that commonly were carried on in her presence had
for her so little interest that she scarcely heard them. The
world in which she moved was a glorified world,&mdash;wherein
to be sure, the forms of every-day life appeared, but appeared
as different from what they were in reality as the
old mouldering daylight view of Rome is from the warm
translucent glory of its evening transfiguration.</p>

<p>So in her quiet, silent heart she nursed this beautiful
hope of finding in Rome the earthly image of her Saviour's
home above, of finding in the head of the Church the real
image of her Redeemer,&mdash;the friend to whom the poorest
and lowliest may pour out their souls with as much freedom
as the highest and noblest. The spiritual directors who
had formed the mind of Agnes in her early days had been
persons in the same manner taught to move in an ideal
world of faith. The Mother Theresa had never seen the
realities of life, and supposed the Church on earth to be all
that the fondest visions of human longing could paint it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
The hard, energetic, prose experience of old Jocunda, and
the downright way with which she sometimes spoke of
things as a trooper's wife must have seen them, were repressed
and hushed down, as the imperfect faith of a half-reclaimed
worldling,&mdash;they could not be allowed to awaken
her from the sweetness of so blissful a dream. In like
manner, when Lorenzo Sforza became Father Francesco, he
strove with earnest prayer to bury his gift of individual
reason in the same grave with his family name and worldly
experience. As to all that transpired in the real world, he
wrapped himself in a mantle of imperturbable silence; the
intrigues of popes and cardinals, once well known to him,
sank away as a forbidden dream; and by some metaphysical
process of imaginative devotion, he enthroned God in
the place of the dominant powers, and taught himself to
receive all that came from them in uninquiring submission,
as proceeding from unerring wisdom. Though he had begun
his spiritual life under the impulse of Savonarola, yet
so perfect had been his isolation from all tidings of what
transpired in the external world that the conflict which
was going on between that distinguished man and the
Papal hierarchy never reached his ear. He sought and
aimed as much as possible to make his soul like the soul of
one dead, which adores and worships in ideal space, and
forgets forever the scenes and relations of earth; and he
had so long contemplated Rome under the celestial aspects
of his faith, that, though the shock of his first confession
there had been painful, still it was insufficient to shake his
faith. It had been God's will, he thought, that where he
looked for aid he should meet only confusion, and he bowed
to the inscrutable will, and blindly adored the mysterious
revelation. If such could be the submission and the faith
of a strong and experienced man, who can wonder at the
enthusiastic illusions of an innocent, trustful child?</p>

<p>Agnes and her grandmother entered the city of Rome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
just as the twilight had faded into night; and though
Agnes, full of faith and enthusiasm, was longing to begin
immediately the ecstatic vision of shrines and holy places,
old Elsie commanded her not to think of anything further
that night. They proceeded, therefore, with several other
pilgrims who had entered the city, to a church specially set
apart for their reception, connected with which were large
dormitories and a religious order whose business was to
receive and wait upon them, and to see that all their wants
were supplied. This religious foundation is one of the
oldest in Rome; and it is esteemed a work of especial
merit and sanctity among the citizens to associate themselves
temporarily in these labors in Holy Week. Even
princes and princesses come, humble and lowly, mingling
with those of common degree, and all, calling each other
brother and sister, vie in kind attentions to these guests
of the Church.</p>

<p>When Agnes and Elsie arrived, several of these volunteer
assistants were in waiting. Agnes was remarked
among all the rest of the company for her peculiar beauty
and the rapt enthusiastic expression of her face.</p>

<p>Almost immediately on their entrance into the reception
hall connected with the church, they seemed to attract the
attention of a tall lady dressed in deep mourning, and
accompanied by a female servant, with whom she was
conversing on those terms of intimacy which showed
confidential relations between the two.</p>

<p>"See!" she said, "my Mona, what a heavenly face is
there!&mdash;that sweet child has certainly the light of grace
shining through her. My heart warms to her."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said the old servant, looking across, "and
well it may,&mdash;dear lamb come so far! But, Holy Virgin,
how my head swims! How strange!&mdash;that child reminds
me of some one. My Lady, perhaps, may think of some
one whom she looks like."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
"Mona, you say true. I have the same strange impression
that I have seen a face like hers, but who or where I
cannot say."</p>

<p>"What would my Lady say, if I said it was our dear
Prince?&mdash;God rest his soul!"</p>

<p>"Mona, it <i>is</i> so,&mdash;yes," added the lady, looking more
intently, "how singular!&mdash;the very traits of our house in
a peasant-girl! She is of Sorrento, I judge, by her costume,&mdash;what
a pretty one it is! That old woman is her
mother, perhaps. I must choose her for my care,&mdash;and,
Mona, you shall wait on her mother."</p>

<p>So saying, the Princess Paulina crossed the hall, and,
bending affably over Agnes, took her hand and kissed her,
<span class="locked">saying,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Welcome, my dear little sister, to the house of our
Father!"</p>

<p>Agnes looked up with strange, wondering eyes into the
face that was bent to hers. It was sallow and sunken,
with deep lines of ill-health and sorrow, but the features
were noble, and must once have been beautiful; the whole
action, voice, and manner were dignified and impressive.
Instinctively she felt that the lady was of superior birth
and breeding to any with whom she had been in the habit
of associating.</p>

<p>"Come with me," said the lady; "and this&mdash;your
mother"&mdash;she added.</p>

<p>"She is my grandmother," said Agnes.</p>

<p>"Well, then, your grandmother, sweet child, shall be
attended to by my good sister Mona here."</p>

<p>The Princess Paulina drew the hand of Agnes through
her arm, and, laying her hand affectionately on it, looked
down and smiled tenderly on her.</p>

<p>"Are you very tired, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! no!" said Agnes,&mdash;"I am so happy, so
blessed to be here!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
"You have traveled a long way?"</p>

<p>"Yes, from Sorrento; but I am used to walking,&mdash;I
did not feel it to be long,&mdash;my heart kept me up,&mdash;I
wanted to come home so much."</p>

<p>"Home?" said the Princess.</p>

<p>"Yes, to my soul's home,&mdash;the house of our dear
Father the Pope."</p>

<p>The Princess started, and looked incredulously down for
a moment; then noticing the confiding, whole-hearted air
of the child, she sighed and was silent.</p>

<p>"Come with me above," she said, "and let me attend
a little to your comfort."</p>

<p>"How good you are, dear lady!" said Agnes.</p>

<p>"I am not good, my child,&mdash;I am only your unworthy
sister in Christ;" and as the lady spoke, she opened the
door into a room where were a number of other female pilgrims
seated around the wall, each attended by a person
whose peculiar care she seemed to be.</p>

<p>At the feet of each was a vessel of water, and when the
seats were all full, a cardinal in robes of office entered, and
began reading prayers. Each lady present, kneeling at the
feet of her chosen pilgrim, divested them carefully of their
worn and travel-soiled shoes and stockings, and proceeded
to wash them. It was not a mere rose-water ceremony,
but a good hearty washing of feet that for the most part
had great need of the ablution. While this service was
going on, the cardinal read from the Gospel how a Greater
than they all had washed the feet of His disciples, and
said, "If I, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet,
ye also ought to wash one another's feet." Then all repeated
in concert the Lord's Prayer, while each humbly
kissed the feet she had washed, and proceeded to replace
the worn and travel-soiled shoes and stockings with new
and strong ones, the gift of Christian love. Each lady
then led her charge into a room where tables were spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
with a plain and wholesome repast of all such articles of
food as the season of Lent allowed. Each placed her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">protégée</i>
at table, and carefully attended to all her wants at
the supper, and afterwards dormitories were opened for
their repose.</p>

<p>The Princess Paulina performed all these offices for
Agnes with a tender earnestness which won upon her heart.
The young girl thought herself indeed in that blessed society
of which she had dreamed, where the high-born and
the rich become through Christ's love the servants of the
poor and lowly; and through all the services she sat in a
sort of dream of rapture. How lovely this reception
into the Holy City! how sweet thus to be taken to the
arms of the great Christian family, bound together in the
charity which is the bond of perfectness!</p>

<p>"Please tell me, dear lady," said Agnes, after supper,
"who is that holy man that prayed with us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he&mdash;he is the Cardinal Capello," said the Princess.</p>

<p>"I should like to have spoken with him," said Agnes.</p>

<p>"Why, my child?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask him when and how I could get speech
with our dear Father the Pope, for there is somewhat on
my mind that I would lay before him."</p>

<p>"My poor little sister," said the Princess, much perplexed,
"you do not understand things. What you speak
of is impossible. The Pope is a great king."</p>

<p>"I know he is," said Agnes,&mdash;"and so is our Lord
Jesus; but every soul may come to him."</p>

<p>"I cannot explain to you now," said the Princess,&mdash;"there
is not time to-night. But I shall see you again.
I will send for you to come to my house, and there talk
with you about many things which you need to know.
Meanwhile, promise me, dear child, not to try to do anything
of the kind you spoke of until I have talked with
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
"Well, I will not," said Agnes, with a glance of docile
affection, kissing the hand of the Princess.</p>

<p>The action was so pretty,&mdash;the great, soft, dark eyes
looked so fawn-like and confiding in their innocent tenderness,
that the lady seemed much moved.</p>

<p>"Our dear Mother bless thee, child!" she said, laying
her hand on her head, and stooping to kiss her forehead.</p>

<p>She left her at the door of the dormitory.</p>

<p>The Princess and her attendant went out of the church-door,
where her litter stood in waiting. The two took
their seats in silence, and silently pursued their way through
the streets of the old dimly-lighted city and out of one of
its principal gates to the wide Campagna beyond. The
villa of the Princess was situated on an eminence at some
distance from the city, and the night-ride to it was solemn
and solitary. They passed along the old Appian Way over
pavements that had rumbled under the chariot-wheels of
the emperors and nobles of a bygone age, while along their
way, glooming up against the clear of the sky, were vast
shadowy piles,&mdash;the tombs of the dead of other days.
All mouldering and lonely, shaggy and fringed with bushes
and streaming wild vines through which the night-wind
sighed and rustled, they might seem to be pervaded by the
restless spirits of the dead; and as the lady passed them,
she shivered, and, crossing herself, repeated an inward
prayer against wandering demons that walk in desolate
places.</p>

<p>Timid and solitary, the high-born lady shrank and cowered
within herself with a distressing feeling of loneliness.
A childless widow in delicate health, whose paternal family
had been for the most part cruelly robbed, exiled, or destroyed
by the reigning Pope and his family, she felt her
own situation a most unprotected and precarious one, since
the least jealousy or misunderstanding might bring upon
her, too, the ill-will of the Borgias, which had proved so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
fatal to the rest of her race. No comfort in life remained
to her but her religion, to whose practice she clung as to
her all; but even in this her life was embittered by facts
to which, with the best disposition in the world, she could
not shut her eyes. Her own family had been too near the
seat of power not to see all the base intrigues by which
that sacred and solemn position of Head of the Christian
Church had been traded for as a marketable commodity.
The pride, the indecency, the cruelty of those who now
reigned in the name of Christ came over her mind in contrast
with the picture painted by the artless, trusting faith
of the peasant-girl with whom she had just parted. Her
mind had been too thoroughly drilled in the non-reflective
practice of her faith to dare to put forth any act of reasoning
upon facts so visible and so tremendous,&mdash;she rather
trembled at herself for seeing what she saw and for knowing
what she knew, and feared somehow that this very
knowledge might endanger her salvation; and so she rode
homeward cowering and praying like a frightened child.</p>

<p>"Does my Lady feel ill?" said the old servant, anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, Mona, no,&mdash;not in body."</p>

<p>"And what is on my Lady's mind now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mona, it is only what is always there. To-morrow
is Palm Sunday, and how can I go to see the murderers
and robbers of our house in holy places? Oh, Mona, what
can Christians do, when such men handle holy things? It
was a comfort to wash the feet of those poor simple pilgrims,
who tread in the steps of the saints of old; but how
I felt when that poor child spoke of wanting to see the
Pope!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mona, "it's like sending the lamb to get
spiritual counsel of the wolf."</p>

<p>"See what sweet belief the poor infant has! Should
not the head of the Christian Church be such as she thinks?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
Ah, in the old days, when the Church here in Rome was
poor and persecuted, there were Popes who were loving
fathers and not haughty princes."</p>

<p>"My dear Lady," said the servant, "pray, consider, the
very stones have ears. We don't know what day we may
be turned out, neck and heels, to make room for some of
their creatures."</p>

<p>"Well, Mona," said the lady, with some spirit, "I'm
sure I haven't said any more than you have."</p>

<p>"Holy Mother! and so you haven't, but somehow things
look more dangerous when other people say them. A
pretty child that was, as you say; but that old thing, her
grandmother, is a sharp piece. She is a Roman, and lived
here in her early days. She says the little one was born
hereabouts; but she shuts up her mouth like a vise, when
one would get more out of her."</p>

<p>"Mona, I shall not go out to-morrow; but you go to the
services, and find the girl and her grandmother, and bring
them out to me. I want to counsel the child."</p>

<p>"You may be sure," said Mona, "that her grandmother
knows the ins and outs of Rome as well as any of us, for
all she has learned to screw up her lips so tight."</p>

<p>"At any rate, bring her to me, because she interests
me."</p>

<p>"Well, well, it shall be so," said Mona.</p>

<span class="smaller">PALM SUNDAY</span></h2>

<p>The morning after her arrival in Rome, Agnes was
awakened from sleep by a solemn dropping of bell-tones
which seemed to fill the whole air, intermingled dimly at
intervals with long-drawn plaintive sounds of chanting.
She had slept profoundly, overwearied with her pilgrimage,
and soothed by that deep lulling sense of quiet which
comes over one, when, after long and weary toils, some
auspicious goal is at length reached. She had come to
Rome, and been received with open arms into the household
of the saints, and seen even those of highest degree
imitating the simplicity of the Lord in serving the poor.
Surely, this was indeed the house of God and the gate of
heaven; and so the bell-tones and chants, mingling with
her dreams, seemed naturally enough angel-harpings and
distant echoes of the perpetual adoration of the blessed.
She rose and dressed herself with a tremulous joy. She
felt full hope that somehow&mdash;in what way she could not
say&mdash;this auspicious beginning would end in a full fruition
of all her wishes, an answer to all her prayers.</p>

<p>"Well, child," said old Elsie, "you must have slept
well; you look fresh as a lark."</p>

<p>"The air of this holy place revives me," said Agnes,
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"I wish I could say as much," said Elsie. "My bones
ache yet with the tramp, and I suppose nothing will do
but we must go out now to all the holy places, up and
down and hither and yon, to everything that goes on. I
saw enough of it all years ago when I lived here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
"Dear grandmother, if you are tired, why should you
not rest? I can go forth alone in this holy city. No
harm can possibly befall me here. I can join any of the
pilgrims who are going to the holy places where I long to
worship."</p>

<p>"A likely story!" said Elsie. "I know more about old
Rome than you do, and I tell you, child, that you do not
stir out a step without me; so if you must go, I must go
too,&mdash;and like enough it's for my soul's health. I suppose
it is," she added, after a reflective pause.</p>

<p>"How beautiful it was that we were welcomed so last
night!" said Agnes; "that dear lady was so kind to me!"</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, and well she might be!" said Elsie, nodding
her head. "But there's no truth in the kindness of the
nobles to us, child. They don't do it because they love
us, but because they expect to buy heaven by washing our
feet and giving us what little they can clip and snip off
from their abundance."</p>

<p>"Oh, grandmother," said Agnes, "how can you say so?
Certainly, if any one ever spoke and looked lovingly, it
was that dear lady."</p>

<p>"Yes, and she rolls away in her carriage, well content,
and leaves you with a pair of new shoes and stockings,&mdash;you,
as worthy of a carriage and a palace as she."</p>

<p>"No, grandmamma; she said she should send for me
to talk more with her."</p>

<p>"<i>She</i> said she should send for you?" said Elsie.
"Well, well, that is strange, to be sure!&mdash;that is wonderful!"
she added, reflectively. "But come, child, we must
hasten through our breakfast and prayers, and go to see the
Pope, and all the great birds with fine feathers that fly
after him."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" said Agnes, joyfully. "Oh, grandmamma,
what a blessed sight it will be!"</p>

<p>"Yes, child, and a fine sight enough he makes with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
great canopy and his plumes and his servants and his trumpeters;&mdash;there
isn't a king in Christendom that goes so
proudly as he."</p>

<p>"No other king is worthy of it," said Agnes. "The
Lord reigns in him."</p>

<p>"Much you know about it!" said Elsie, between her
teeth, as they started out.</p>

<p>The streets of Rome through which they walked were
damp and cellar-like, filthy and ill-paved; but Agnes neither
saw nor felt anything of inconvenience in this: had
they been floored, like those of the New Jerusalem, with
translucent gold, her faith could not have been more fervent.</p>

<p>Rome is at all times a forest of quaint costumes, a pantomime
of shifting scenic effects of religious ceremonies.
Nothing there, however singular, strikes the eye as out-of-the-way
or unexpected, since no one knows precisely to
what religious order it may belong, or what individual vow
or purpose it may represent. Neither Agnes nor Elsie,
therefore, was surprised, when they passed through the
doorway to the street, at the apparition of a man covered
from head to foot in a long robe of white serge, with a
high-peaked cap of the same material drawn completely
down over his head and face. Two round holes cut in
this ghostly head-gear revealed simply two black glittering
eyes, which shone with that singular elfish effect which
belongs to the human eye when removed from its appropriate
and natural accessories. As they passed out, the figure
rattled a box on which was painted an image of despairing
souls raising imploring hands from very red tongues of
flame, by which it was understood at once that he sought
aid for souls in Purgatory. Agnes and her grandmother
each dropped therein a small coin and went on their way;
but the figure followed them at a little distance behind,
keeping carefully within sight of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
By means of energetic pushing and striving, Elsie contrived
to secure for herself and her grandchild stations in
the piazza in front of the church, in the very front rank,
where the procession was to pass. A motley assemblage
it was, this crowd, comprising every variety of costume of
rank and station and ecclesiastical profession,&mdash;cowls and
hoods of Franciscan and Dominican,&mdash;picturesque head
dresses of peasant-women of different districts,&mdash;plumes
and ruffs of more aspiring gentility,&mdash;mixed with every
quaint phase of foreign costume belonging to the strangers
from different parts of the earth;&mdash;for, like the old
Jewish Passover, this celebration of Holy Week had its
assemblage of Parthians, Medes, Elamites, dwellers in
Mesopotamia, Cretes, and Arabians, all blending in one
common memorial.</p>

<p>Amid the strange variety of persons among whom they
were crowded, Elsie remarked the stranger in the white
sack, who had followed them, and who had stationed himself
behind them,&mdash;but it did not occur to her that his
presence there was other than merely accidental.</p>

<p>And now came sweeping up the grand procession, brilliant
with scarlet and gold, waving with plumes, sparkling
with gems,&mdash;it seemed as if earth had been ransacked and
human invention taxed to express the ultimatum of all that
could dazzle and bewilder,&mdash;and, with a rustle like that
of ripe grain before a swaying wind, all the multitude went
down on their knees as the cortege passed. Agnes knelt,
too, with clasped hands, adoring the sacred vision enshrined
in her soul; and as she knelt with upraised eyes, her cheeks
flushed with enthusiasm, her beauty attracted the attention
of more than one in the procession.</p>

<p>"There is the model which our master has been looking
for," said a young and handsome man in a rich dress of
black velvet, who, by his costume, appeared to hold the
rank of first chamberlain in the Papal suite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
The young man to whom he spoke gave a bold glance at
Agnes and <span class="locked">answered,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Pretty little rogue, how well she does the saint!"</p>

<p>"One can see that with judicious arrangement she might
make a nymph as well as a saint," said the first speaker.</p>

<p>"A Daphne, for example," said the other, laughing.</p>

<p>"And she wouldn't turn into a laurel, either," said the
first. "Well, we must keep our eye on her." And as
they were passing into the church-door, he beckoned to a
servant in waiting and whispered something, indicating
Agnes with a backward movement of his hand.</p>

<p>The servant, after this, kept cautiously within observing
distance of her, as she with the crowd pressed into the
church to assist at the devotions.</p>

<p>Long and dazzling were those ceremonies, when, raised
on high like an enthroned God, Pope Alexander VI. received
the homage of bended knee from the ambassadors of
every Christian nation, from heads of all ecclesiastical orders,
and from generals and chiefs and princes and nobles,
who, robed and plumed and gemmed in all the brightest
and proudest that earth could give, bowed the knee humbly
and kissed his foot in return for the palm-branch which he
presented. Meanwhile, voices of invisible singers chanted
the simple event which all this splendor was commemorating,&mdash;how
of old Jesus came into Jerusalem meek and
lowly, riding on an ass,&mdash;how His disciples cast their garments
in the way, and the multitude took branches of
palm-trees to come forth and meet Him,&mdash;how He was
seized, tried, condemned to a cruel death,&mdash;and the crowd,
with dazzled and wondering eyes following the gorgeous
ceremonial, reflected little how great was the satire of the
contrast, how different the coming of that meek and lowly
One to suffer and to die from this triumphant display of
worldly pomp and splendor in His professed representative.</p>

<p>But to the pure all things are pure, and Agnes thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
only of the enthronement of all virtues, of all celestial
charities and unworldly purities in that splendid ceremonial,
and longed within herself to approach so near as to
touch the hem of those wondrous and sacred garments. It
was to her enthusiastic imagination like the unclosing of
celestial doors, where the kings and priests of an eternal
and heavenly temple move to and fro in music, with the
many-colored glories of rainbows and sunset clouds. Her
whole nature was wrought upon by the sights and sounds
of that gorgeous worship,&mdash;she seemed to burn and brighten
like an altar-coal, her figure appeared to dilate, her eyes
grew deeper and shone with a starry light, and the color of
her cheeks flushed up with a vivid glow; nor was she
aware how often eyes were turned upon her, nor how murmurs
of admiration followed all her absorbed, unconscious
movements. "<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">Ecco! Eccola!</i>" was often repeated from
mouth to mouth around her, but she heard it not.</p>

<p>When at last the ceremony was finished, the crowd
rushed again out of the church to see the departure of
various dignitaries. There was a perfect whirl of dazzling
equipages, and glittering lackeys, and prancing horses,
crusted with gold, flaming in scarlet and purple, retinues
of cardinals and princes and nobles and ambassadors all in
one splendid confused jostle of noise and brightness.</p>

<p>Suddenly a servant in a gorgeous scarlet livery touched
Agnes on the shoulder, and said, in a tone of <span class="locked">authority,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Young maiden, your presence is commanded."</p>

<p>"Who commands it?" said Elsie, laying her hand on
her grandchild's shoulder fiercely.</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" whispered two or three women of the
lower orders to Elsie at once; "don't you know who that
is? Hush, for your life!"</p>

<p>"I shall go with you, Agnes," said Elsie, resolutely.</p>

<p>"No, you will not," said the attendant, insolently.
"This maiden is commanded, and none else."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
"He belongs to the Pope's nephew," whispered a voice
in Elsie's ear. "You had better have your tongue torn
out than say another word." Whereupon, Elsie found
herself actually borne backward by three or four stout
women.</p>

<p>Agnes looked round and smiled on her,&mdash;a smile full
of innocent trust,&mdash;and then, turning, followed the servant
into the finest of the equipages, where she was lost
to view.</p>

<p>Elsie was almost wild with fear and impotent rage; but
a low, impressive voice now spoke in her ear. It came
from the white figure which had followed them in the
morning.</p>

<p>"Listen," it said, "and be quiet; don't turn your head,
but hear what I tell you. Your child is followed by those
who will save her. Go your ways whence you came.
Wait till the hour after the Ave Maria, then come to the
Porta San Sebastiano, and all will be well."</p>

<p>When Elsie turned to look she saw no one, but caught
a distant glimpse of a white figure vanishing in the crowd.
She returned to her asylum, wondering and disconsolate,
and the first person whom she saw was old Mona.</p>

<p>"Well, good-morrow, sister!" she said. "Know that
I am here on a strange errand. The Princess has taken
such a liking to you that nothing will do but we must
fetch you and your little one out to her villa. I looked
everywhere for you in church this morning. Where have
you hid yourselves?"</p>

<p>"We were there," said Elsie, confused, and hesitating
whether to speak of what had happened.</p>

<p>"Well, where is the little one? Get her ready; we
have horses in waiting. It is a good bit out of the city."</p>

<p>"Alack!" said Elsie, "I know not where she is."</p>

<p>"Holy Virgin!" said Mona, "how is this?"</p>

<p>Elsie, moved by the necessity which makes it a relief to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
open the heart to some one, sat down on the steps of the
church and poured forth the whole story into the listening
ear of Mona.</p>

<p>"Well, well, well!" said the old servant, "in our days,
one does not wonder at anything, one never knows one day
what may come the next,&mdash;but this is bad enough!"</p>

<p>"Do you think," said Elsie, "there is any hope in that
strange promise?"</p>

<p>"One can but try it," said Mona.</p>

<p>"If you could but be there then," said Elsie, "and take
us to your mistress."</p>

<p>"Well, I will wait, for my mistress has taken an especial
fancy to your little one, more particularly since this morning,
when a holy Capuchin came to our house and held a
long conference with her, and after he was gone I found
my lady almost in a faint, and she would have it that we
should start directly to bring her out here, and I had much
ado to let her see that the child would do quite as well
after services were over. I tired myself looking about for
you in the crowd."</p>

<p>The two women then digressed upon various gossiping
particulars, as they sat on the old mossy, grass-grown steps,
looking up over house-tops yellow with lichen, into the
blue spring air, where flocks of white pigeons were soaring
and careering in the soft, warm sunshine. Brightness and
warmth and flowers seemed to be the only idea natural to
that charming weather, and Elsie, sad-hearted and foreboding
as she was, felt the benign influence. Rome, which
had been so fatal a place to her peace, yet had for her, as
it has for every one, potent spells of a lulling and soothing
power. Where is the grief or anxiety that can resist the
enchantment of one of Rome's bright, soft, spring days?</p>

<span class="smaller">THE NIGHT-RIDE</span></h2>

<p>The villa of the Princess Paulina was one of those soft,
idyllic paradises which lie like so many fairy-lands around
the dreamy solitudes of Rome. They are so fair, so wild,
so still, these villas! Nature in them seems to run in such
gentle sympathy with Art, that one feels as if they had
not been so much the product of human skill as some indigenous
growth of Arcadian ages. There are quaint terraces
shadowed by clipped ilex-trees, whose branches make
twilight even in the sultriest noon; there are long-drawn
paths, through wildernesses where cyclamens blossom in
crimson clouds among crushed fragments of sculptured marble
green with the moss of ages, and glossy-leaved myrtles
put forth their pale blue stars in constellations under the
leafy shadows. Everywhere is the voice of water, ever
lulling, ever babbling, and taught by Art to run in many
a quaint caprice,&mdash;here to rush down marble steps slippery
with sedgy green, there to spout up in silvery spray, and
anon to spread into a cool, waveless lake, whose mirror
reflects trees and flowers far down in some visionary underworld.
Then there are wide lawns, where the grass in
spring is a perfect rainbow of anemones, white, rose, crimson,
purple, mottled, streaked, and dappled with ever
varying shade of sunset clouds. There are soft, moist
banks where purple and white violets grow large and fair,
and trees all interlaced with ivy, which runs and twines
everywhere, intermingling its dark, graceful leaves and
vivid young shoots with the bloom and leafage of all shadowy
places.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
In our day, these lovely places have their dark shadow
ever haunting their loveliness: the malaria, like an unseen
demon, lies hid in their sweetness. And in the time we
are speaking of, a curse not less deadly poisoned the beauties
of the Princess's villa,&mdash;the malaria of fear.</p>

<p>The graveled terrace in front of the villa commanded,
through the clipped arches of the ilex-trees, the Campagna
with its soft, undulating bands of many-colored green, and
the distant city of Rome, whose bells were always filling
the air between with a tremulous vibration. Here, during
the long sunny afternoon while Elsie and Monica were
crooning together on the steps of the church, the Princess
Paulina walked restlessly up and down, looking forth on
the way towards the city for the travelers whom she expected.</p>

<p>Father Francesco had been there that morning and communicated
to her the dying message of the aged Capuchin,
from which it appeared that the child who had so much
interested her was her near kinswoman. Perhaps, had her
house remained at the height of its power and splendor,
she might have rejected with scorn the idea of a kinswoman
whose existence had been owing to a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mésalliance</i>; but a
member of an exiled and disinherited family, deriving her
only comfort from unworldly sources, she regarded this
event as an opportunity afforded her to make expiation for
one of the sins of her house. The beauty and winning
graces of her young kinswoman were not without their influence
in attracting a lonely heart deprived of the support
of natural ties. The Princess longed for something to love,
and the discovery of a legitimate object of family affection
was an event in the weary monotony of her life; and therefore
it was that the hours of the afternoon seemed long
while she looked forth towards Rome, listening to the
ceaseless chiming of its bells, and wondering why no one
appeared along the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
The sun went down, and all the wide plain seemed like
the sea at twilight, lying in rosy and lilac and purple shadowy
bands, out of which rose the old city, solemn and
lonely as some enchanted island of dreamland, with a flush
of radiance behind it and a tolling of weird music filling
all the air around. Now they are chanting the Ave Maria
in hundreds of churches, and the Princess worships in distant
accord, and tries to still the anxieties of her heart with
many a prayer. Twilight fades and fades, the Campagna
becomes a black sea, and the distant city looms up like a
dark rock against the glimmering sky, and the Princess
goes within and walks restlessly through the wide halls,
stopping first at one open window and then at another to
listen. Beneath her feet she treads a cool mosaic pavement
where laughing Cupids are dancing. Above, from the ceiling,
Aurora and the Hours look down in many-colored
clouds of brightness. The sound of the fountains without
is so clear in the intense stillness that the peculiar voice of
each one can be told. That is the swaying noise of the
great jet that rises from marble shells and falls into a wide
basin, where silvery swans swim round and round in enchanted
circles; and the other slenderer sound is the
smaller jet that rains down its spray into the violet-borders
deep in the shrubbery; and that other, the shallow babble
of the waters that go down the marble steps to the lake.
How dreamlike and plaintive they all sound in the night
stillness! The nightingale sings from the dark shadows of
the wilderness; and the musky odors of the cyclamen
come floating ever and anon through the casement, in that
strange, cloudy way in which flower scents seem to come
and go in the air in the night season.</p>

<p>At last the Princess fancies she hears the distant tramp
of horses' feet, and her heart beats so that she can scarcely
listen: now she hears it,&mdash;and now a rising wind, sweeping
across the Campagna, seems to bear it moaning away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
She goes to a door and looks out into the darkness. Yes,
she hears it now, quick and regular,&mdash;the beat of many
horses' feet coming in hot haste along the road. Surely
the few servants whom she has sent cannot make all this
noise! and she trembles with vague affright. Perhaps it
is a tyrannical message, bringing imprisonment and death.
She calls a maid, and bids her bring lights into the reception-hall.
A few moments more, and there is a confused
stamping of horses' feet approaching the house, and she
hears the voices of her servants. She runs into the piazza,
and sees dismounting a knight who carries Agnes in his
arms pale and fainting. Old Elsie and Monica, too, dismount,
with the Princess's men-servants; but, wonderful
to tell, there seems besides them to be a train of some hundred
armed horsemen.</p>

<p>The timid Princess was so fluttered and bewildered that
she lost all presence of mind, and stood in uncomprehending
wonder, while Monica pushed authoritatively into the
house, and beckoned the knight to bring Agnes and lay
her on a sofa, when she and old Elsie busied themselves
vigorously with restoratives.</p>

<p>The Lady Paulina, as soon as she could collect her scattered
senses, recognized in Agostino the banished lord of
the Sarelli family, a race who had shared with her own the
hatred and cruelty of the Borgia tribe; and he in turn had
recognized a daughter of the Colonnas. He drew her aside
into a small boudoir adjoining the apartment.</p>

<p>"Noble lady," he said, "we are companions in misfortune,
and so, I trust, you will pardon what seems a tumultuous
intrusion on your privacy. I and my men came to
Rome in disguise, that we might watch over and protect
this poor innocent, who now finds asylum with you."</p>

<p>"My Lord," said the Princess, "I see in this event the
wonderful working of the good God. I have but just
learned that this young person is my near kinswoman; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
was only this morning that the fact was certified to me on
the dying confession of a holy Capuchin, who privately
united my brother to her mother. The marriage was an
indiscretion of his youth; but afterwards he fell into more
grievous sin in denying the holy sacrament, and leaving his
wife to die in misery and dishonor, and perhaps for this
fault such great judgments fell upon him. I wish to make
atonement in such sort as is yet possible by acting as a
mother to this child."</p>

<p>"The times are so troublous and uncertain," said Agostino,
"that she must have stronger protection than that of
any woman. She is of a most holy and religious nature,
but as ignorant of sin as an angel who never has seen anything
out of heaven; and so the Borgias enticed her into
their impure den, from which, God helping, I have saved
her. I tried all I could to prevent her coming to Rome,
and to convince her of the vileness that ruled here; but
the poor little one could not believe me, and thought me
a heretic only for saying what she now knows from her
own senses."</p>

<p>The Lady Paulina shuddered with fear.</p>

<p>"Is it possible that you have come into collision with
the dreadful Borgias? What will become of us?"</p>

<p>"I brought a hundred men into Rome in different disguises,"
said Agostino, "and we gained over a servant in
their household, through whom I entered and carried her
off. Their men pursued us, and we had a fight in the
streets, but for the moment we mustered more than they.
Some of them chased us a good distance. But it will not
do for us to remain here. As soon as she is revived
enough, we must retreat towards one of our fastnesses in
the mountains, whence, when rested, we shall go northward
to Florence, where I have powerful friends, and she
has also an uncle, a holy man, by whose counsels she is
much guided."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
"You must take me with you," said the Princess, in a
tremor of anxiety. "Not for the world would I stay, if
it be known you have taken refuge here. For a long time
their spies have been watching about me; they only wait
for some occasion to seize upon my villa, as they have
on the possessions of all my father's house. Let me flee
with you. I have a brother-in-law in Florence who hath
often urged me to escape to him till times mend,&mdash;for,
surely, God will not allow the wicked to bear rule forever."</p>

<p>"Willingly, noble lady, will we give you our escort,&mdash;the
more so that this poor child will then have a friend
with her beseeming her father's rank. Believe me, lady,
she will do no discredit to her lineage. She was trained
in a convent, and her soul is a flower of marvelous beauty.
I must declare to you here that I have wooed her honorably
to be my wife, and she would willingly be so, had not
some scruples of a religious vocation taken hold on her, to
dispel which I look for the aid of the holy father, her
uncle."</p>

<p>"It would be a most fit and proper thing," said the
Princess, "thus to ally our houses, in hope of some good
time to come which shall restore their former standing and
possessions. Of course some holy man must judge of the
obstacle interposed by her vocation; but I doubt not the
Church will be an indulgent mother in a case where the
issue seems so desirable."</p>

<p>"If I be married to her," said Agostino, "I can take her
out of all these strifes and confusions which now agitate
our Italy to the court of France, where I have an uncle
high in favor with the King, and who will use all his influence
to compose these troubles in Italy, and bring about
a better day."</p>

<p>While this conversation was going on, bountiful refreshments
had been provided for the whole party, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
attendants of the Princess received orders to pack all her
jewels and valuable effects for a sudden journey.</p>

<p>As soon as preparations could be made, the whole party
left the villa of the Princess for a retreat in the Alban
Mountains, where Agostino and his band had one of their
rendezvous. Only the immediate female attendants of the
Princess, and one or two men-servants, left with her. The
silver plate, and all objects of particular value, were buried
in the garden. This being done, the keys of the house
were intrusted to a gray-headed servant, who with his wife
had grown old in the family.</p>

<p>It was midnight before everything was ready for starting.
The moon cast silver gleams through the ilex-avenues,
and caused the jet of the great fountain to look like a wavering
pillar of cloudy brightness, when the Princess led
forth Agnes upon the wide veranda. Two gentle, yet spirited
little animals from the Princess's stables were there
awaiting them, and they were lifted into their saddles by
Agostino.</p>

<p>"Fear nothing, Madam," he said, observing how the
hands of the Princess trembled; "a few hours will put us
in perfect safety, and I shall be at your side constantly."</p>

<p>Then lifting Agnes to her seat, he placed the reins in
her hand.</p>

<p>"Are you rested?" he asked.</p>

<p>It was the first time since her rescue that he had spoken
to Agnes. The words were brief, but no expressions of
endearment could convey more than the manner in which
they were spoken.</p>

<p>"Yes, my Lord," said Agnes firmly, "I am rested."</p>

<p>"You think you can bear the ride?"</p>

<p>"I can bear anything, so I escape," she said.</p>

<p>The company were now all mounted, and were marshaled
in regular order. A body of armed men rode in
front; then came Agnes and the Princess, with Agostino<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
between them, while two or three troopers rode on either
side; Elsie, Monica, and the servants of the Princess followed
close behind, and the rear was brought up in like
manner by armed men.</p>

<p>The path wound first through the grounds of the villa,
with its plats of light and shade, its solemn groves of stone-pines
rising like palm-trees high in air above the tops of
all other trees, its terraces and statues and fountains,&mdash;all
seeming so lovely in the midnight stillness.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am leaving all this forever," said the Princess.</p>

<p>"Let us hope for the best," said Agostino. "It cannot
be that God will suffer the seat of the Apostles to be subjected
to such ignominy and disgrace much longer. I am
amazed that no Christian kings have interfered before for
the honor of Christendom. I have it from the best authority
that the King of Naples burst into tears when he heard
of the election of this wretch to be Pope. He said that
it was a scandal which threatened the very existence of
Christianity. He has sent me secret messages divers times
expressive of sympathy, but he is not of himself strong
enough. Our hope must lie either in the King of France
or the Emperor of Germany: perhaps both will engage.
There is now a most holy monk in Florence who has been
stirring all hearts in a wonderful way. It is said that the
very gifts of miracles and prophecy are revived in him, as
among the holy Apostles, and he has been bestirring himself
to have a General Council of the Church to look into
these matters. When I left Florence, a short time ago,
the faction opposed to him broke into the convent and took
him away. I myself was there."</p>

<p>"What!" said Agnes, "did they break into the convent
of the San Marco? My uncle is there."</p>

<p>"Yes, and he and I fought side by side with the mob
who were rushing in."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
"Uncle Antonio fight!" said Agnes, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Even women will fight, when what they love most is
attacked," said the knight.</p>

<p>He turned to her, as he spoke, and saw in the moonlight
a flash from her eye, and an heroic expression on her face,
such as he had never remarked before; but she said nothing.
The veil had been rudely torn from her eyes; she had seen
with horror the defilement and impurity of what she had
ignorantly adored in holy places, and the revelation seemed
to have wrought a change in her whole nature.</p>

<p>"Even you could fight, Agnes," said the knight, "to
save your religion from disgrace."</p>

<p>"No," said she; "but," she added, with gathering firmness,
"I could die. I should be glad to die with and for
the holy men who would save the honor of the true faith.
I should like to go to Florence to my uncle. If he dies
for his religion, I should like to die with him."</p>

<p>"Ah, live to teach it to me!" said the knight, bending
towards her, as if to adjust her bridle-rein, and speaking
in a voice scarcely audible. In a moment he was turned
again towards the Princess, listening to her.</p>

<p>"So it seems," she said, "that we shall be running into
the thick of the conflict in Florence."</p>

<p>"Yes, but my uncle hath promised that the King of
France shall interfere. I have hope something may even
now have been done. I hope to effect something myself."</p>

<p>Agostino spoke with the cheerful courage of youth.
Agnes glanced timidly up at him. How great the change
in her ideas! No longer looking on him as a wanderer
from the fold, an enemy of the Church, he seemed now in
the attitude of a champion of the faith, a defender of holy
men and things against a base usurpation. What injustice
had she done him, and how patiently had he borne that
injustice! Had he not sought to warn her against the
danger of venturing into that corrupt city? Those words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
which so much shocked her, against which she had shut
her ears, were all true; she had found them so; she could
doubt no longer. And yet he had followed her, and saved
her at the risk of his life. Could she help loving one who
had loved her so much, one so noble and heroic? Would
it be a sin to love him? She pondered the dark warnings
of Father Francesco, and then thought of the cheerful, fervent
piety of her old uncle. How warm, how tender, how
life-giving had been his presence always! how full of faith
and prayer, how fruitful of heavenly words and thoughts
had been all his ministrations!&mdash;and yet it was for him
and with him and his master that Agostino Sarelli was
fighting, and against him the usurping head of the Christian
Church. Then there was another subject for pondering
during this night-ride. The secret of her birth had
been told her by the Princess, who claimed her as kinswoman.
It had seemed to her at first like the revelations
of a dream; but as she rode and reflected, gradually the
idea shaped itself in her mind. She was, in birth and
blood, the equal of her lover, and henceforth her life would
no more be in that lowly plane where it had always moved.
She thought of the little orange-garden at Sorrento, of the
gorge with its old bridge, the Convent, the sisters, with a
sort of tender, wondering pain. Perhaps she should see
them no more. In this new situation she longed once
more to see and talk with her old uncle, and to have him
tell her what were her duties.</p>

<p>Their path soon began to be a wild clamber among the
mountains, now lost in the shadow of groves of gray, rustling
olives, whose knotted, serpent roots coiled round the
rocks, and whose leaves silvered in the moonlight whenever
the wind swayed them. Whatever might be the roughness
and difficulties of the way, Agnes found her knight ever at
her bridle-rein, guiding and upholding, steadying her in
her saddle when the horse plunged down short and sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
descents, and wrapping her in his mantle to protect her
from the chill mountain-air. When the day was just reddening
in the sky, the whole troop made a sudden halt
before a square stone tower which seemed to be a portion
of a ruined building, and here some of the men dismounting
knocked at an arched door. It was soon swung open
by a woman with a lamp in her hand, the light of which
revealed very black hair and eyes, and heavy gold ear-rings.</p>

<p>"Have my directions been attended to?" said Agostino,
in a tone of command. "Are there places made ready for
these ladies to sleep?"</p>

<p>"There are, my Lord," said the woman, obsequiously,
"the best we could get ready on so short a notice."</p>

<p>Agostino came up to the Princess. "Noble Madam,"
he said, "you will value safety before all things; doubtless
the best that can be done here is but poor, but it will give
you a few hours for repose where you may be sure of being
in perfect safety."</p>

<p>So saying, he assisted her and Agnes to dismount, and
Elsie and Monica also alighting, they followed the woman
into a dark stone passage and up some rude stone steps.
She opened at last the door of a brick-floored room, where
beds appeared to have been hastily prepared. There was
no furniture of any sort except the beds. The walls were
dusty and hung with cobwebs. A smaller apartment opening
into this had beds for Elsie and Monica.</p>

<p>The travelers, however, were too much exhausted with
their night-ride to be critical; the services of disrobing and
preparing for rest were quickly concluded, and in less than
an hour all were asleep, while Agostino was busy concerting
the means for an immediate journey to Florence.</p>

<span class="smaller">"LET US ALSO GO, THAT WE MAY DIE WITH HIM"</span></h2>

<p>Father Antonio sat alone in his cell in the San Marco
in an attitude of deep dejection. The open window looked
into the garden of the convent, from which steamed up the
fragrance of violet, jasmine, and rose, and the sunshine lay
fair on all that was without. On a table beside him were
many loose and scattered sketches; and an unfinished page
of the Breviary he was executing, rich in quaint tracery of
gold and arabesques, seemed to have recently occupied his
attention, for his palette was wet and many loose brushes
lay strewed around. Upon the table stood a Venetian glass
with a narrow neck and a bulb clear and thin as a soap-bubble,
containing vines and blossoms of the passion-flower,
which he had evidently been using as models in his work.</p>

<p>The page he was illuminating was the prophetic Psalm
which describes the ignominy and sufferings of the Redeemer.
It was surrounded by a wreathed border of thorn-branches
interwoven with the blossoms and tendrils of the
passion-flower, and the initial letters of the first two words
were formed by a curious combination of the hammer, the
nails, the spear, the crown of thorns, the cross, and other
instruments of the Passion; and clear, in red letter, gleamed
out those wonderful, mysterious words, consecrated by the
remembrance of a more than mortal anguish, "My God, my
God, why hast thou forsaken me?"</p>

<p>The artist monk had perhaps fled to his palette to assuage
the throbbings of his heart, as a mourning mother
flies to the cradle of her child; but even there his grief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
appeared to have overtaken him, for the work lay as if
pushed from him in an access of anguish such as comes
from the sudden recurrence of some overwhelming recollection.
He was leaning forward with his face buried in his
hands, sobbing convulsively.</p>

<p>The door opened, and a man advancing stealthily behind
laid a hand kindly on his shoulder, saying softly, "So, so,
brother!"</p>

<p>Father Antonio looked up, and, dashing his hand hastily
across his eyes, grasped that of the new-comer convulsively,
and saying only, "Oh, Baccio! Baccio!" hid his face
again.</p>

<p>The eyes of the other filled with tears, as he answered
<span class="locked">gently,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"Nay, but, my brother, you are killing yourself. They
tell me that you have eaten nothing for three days, and
slept not for weeks; you will die of this grief."</p>

<p>"Would that I might! Why could not I die with him as
well as Fra Domenico? Oh, my master! my dear master!"</p>

<p>"It is indeed a most heavy day to us all," said Baccio
della Porta, the amiable and pure-minded artist better
known to our times by his conventual name of Fra Bartolommeo.
"Never have we had among us such a man, and
if there be any light of grace in my soul, his preaching first
awakened it, brother. I only wait to see him enter Paradise,
and then I take farewell of the world for ever. I am
going to Prato to take the Dominican habit and follow him
as near as I may."</p>

<p>"It is well, Baccio, it is well," said Father Antonio;
"but you must not put out the light of your genius in
those shadows,&mdash;you must still paint for the glory of
God."</p>

<p>"I have no heart for painting now," said Baccio, dejectedly.
"He was my inspiration, he taught me the holier
way, and he is gone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
At this moment the conference of the two was interrupted
by a knocking at the door, and Agostino Sarelli entered,
pale and disordered.</p>

<p>"How is this?" he said, hastily. "What devils' carnival
is this which hath broken loose in Florence? Every
good thing is gone into dens and holes, and every vile thing
that can hiss and spit and sting is crawling abroad. What
do the princes of Europe mean to let such things be?"</p>

<p>"Only the old story," said Father Antonio,&mdash;"<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Principes
convenerunt in unum adversus Dominum, adversus
Christum ejus.</i>"</p>

<p>So much were all three absorbed in the subject of their
thoughts, that no kind of greeting or mark of recognition
passed among them, such as is common when people meet
after temporary separation. Each spoke out from the fullness
of his soul, as from an overflowing bitter fountain.</p>

<p>"Was there no one to speak for him,&mdash;no one to stand
up for the pride of Italy,&mdash;the man of his age?" said
Agostino.</p>

<p>"There was one voice raised for him in the council,"
said Father Antonio. "There was Agnolo Niccolini: a
grave man is this Agnolo, and of great experience in public
affairs, and he spoke out his mind boldly. He told them
flatly, that, if they looked through the present time or the
past ages they would not meet a man of such a high and
noble order as this, and that to lay at our door the blood
of a man the like of whom might not be born for centuries
was too impious and execrable a thing to be thought of.
I'll warrant me, he made a rustling among them when he
said that, and the Pope's commissary&mdash;old Romalino&mdash;then
whispered and frowned; but Agnolo is a stiff old fellow
when he once begins a thing,&mdash;he never minded it,
and went through with his say. It seems to me he said
that it was not for us to quench a light like this, capable
of giving lustre to the faith even when it had grown dim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
in other parts of the world,&mdash;and not to the faith alone,
but to all the arts and sciences connected with it. If it
were needed to put restraint on him, he said, why not put
him into some fortress, and give him commodious apartments,
with abundance of books, and pen, ink, and paper,
where he would write books to the honor of God and the
exaltation of the holy faith? He told them that this
might be a good to the world, whereas consigning him to
death without use of any kind would bring on our republic
perpetual dishonor."</p>

<p>"Well said for him!" said Baccio, with warmth; "but
I'll warrant me, he might as well have preached to the
north wind in March, his enemies are in such a fury."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Antonio, "it is just as it was of old:
the chief priests and Scribes and Pharisees were instant
with loud voices, requiring he should be put to death; and
the easy Pilates, for fear of the tumult, washed their hands
of it."</p>

<p>"And now," said Agostino, "they are putting up a great
gibbet in the shape of a cross in the public square, where
they will hang the three holiest and best men of Florence!"</p>

<p>"I came through there this morning," said Baccio, "and
there were young men and boys shouting, and howling, and
singing indecent songs, and putting up indecent pictures,
such as those he used to preach against. It is just as you
say. All things vile have crept out of their lair, and triumph
that the man who made them afraid is put down;
and every house is full of the most horrible lies about him,&mdash;things
that they said he confessed."</p>

<p>"Confessed!" said Father Antonio,&mdash;"was it not
enough that they tore and tortured him seven times, but
they must garble and twist the very words that he said in
his agony? The process they have published is foully
falsified,&mdash;stuffed full of improbable lies; for I myself
have read the first draught of all he <i>did</i> say, just as Signor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
Ceccone took it down as they were torturing him. I had
it from Jacopo Manelli, canon of our Duomo here, and
he got it from Ceccone's wife herself. They not only can
torture and slay him, but they torture and slay his memory
with lies."</p>

<p>"Would I were in God's place for one day!" said
Agostino, speaking through his clenched teeth. "May I
be forgiven for saying so!"</p>

<p>"<i>We</i> are hot and hasty," said Father Antonio, "ever
ready to call down fire from heaven; but after all, 'the
Lord reigneth, let the earth rejoice.' 'Unto the upright
there ariseth light in the darkness.' Our dear father is
sustained in spirit and full of love. Even when they let
him go from the torture, he fell on his knees, praying for
his tormentors."</p>

<p>"Good God! this passes me!" said Agostino, striking
his hands together. "Oh, wherefore hath a strong man
arms and hands, and a sword, if he must stand still and see
such things done? If I had only my hundred mountaineers
here, I would make one charge for him to-morrow. If
I could only <i>do</i> something," he added, striding impetuously
up and down the cell and clenching his fists. "What!
hath nobody petitioned to stay this thing?"</p>

<p>"Nobody for him," said Father Antonio. "There was
talk in the city yesterday that Fra Domenico was to be
pardoned; in fact, Romalino was quite inclined to do it,
but Battista Alberti talked violently against it, and so Romalino
said, 'Well, a monk more or less isn't much matter,'
and then he put his name down for death with the
rest. The order was signed by both commissaries of the
Pope, and one was Fra Turiano, the general of our order,
a mild man, full of charity, but unable to stand against the
Pope."</p>

<p>"Mild men are nuisances in such places," said Agostino,
hastily; "our times want something of another sort."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
"There be many who have fallen away from him even
in our house here," said Father Antonio, "as it was with
our blessed Lord, whose disciples forsook Him and fled. It
seems to be the only thought with some how they shall
make their peace with the Pope."</p>

<p>"And so the thing will be hurried through to-morrow,"
said Agostino, "and when it's done and over, I'll warrant
me there will be found kings and emperors to say they
meant to have saved him. It's a vile, evil world, this of
ours; an honorable man longs to see the end of it. But,"
he added, coming up and speaking to Father Antonio, "I
have a private message for you."</p>

<p>"I am gone this moment," said Baccio, rising with ready
courtesy; "but keep up heart, brother."</p>

<p>So saying, the good-hearted artist left the cell, and
Agostino <span class="locked">said,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I bring tidings to you of your kindred. Your niece
and sister are here in Florence, and would see you. You
will find them at the house of one Gherardo Rosselli, a
rich citizen of noble blood."</p>

<p>"Why are they there?" said the monk, lost in amazement.</p>

<p>"You must know, then, that a most singular discovery
hath been made by your niece at Rome. The sister of her
father, being a lady of the princely blood of Colonna, hath
been assured of her birth by the confession of the priest
that married him; and being driven from Rome by fear of
the Borgias, they came hither under my escort, and wait to
see you. So, if you will come with me now, I will guide
you to them."</p>

<p>"Even so," said Father Antonio.</p>

<hr />

<h2 class="vspace2"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI</a><br />

<span class="smaller">MARTYRDOM</span></h2>

<p>In a shadowy chamber of a room overlooking the grand
square of Florence might be seen, on the next morning,
some of the principal personages of our story. Father Antonio,
Baccio della Porta, Agostino Sarelli, the Princess
Paulina, Agnes, with her grandmother, and a mixed crowd
of citizens and ecclesiastics, who all spoke in hushed and
tremulous voices, as men do in the chamber of mourners at
a funeral. The great, mysterious bell of the Campanile
was swinging with dismal, heart-shaking toll, like a mighty
voice from the spirit-world; and it was answered by the
tolling of all the bells in the city, making such wavering
clangors and vibrating circles in the air over Florence that
it might seem as if it were full of warring spirits wrestling
for mastery.</p>

<p>Toll! toll! toll! O great bell of the fair Campanile! for
this day the noblest of the wonderful men of Florence is
to be offered up. Toll! for an era is going out,&mdash;the era
of her artists, her statesmen, her poets, and her scholars.
Toll! for an era is coming in,&mdash;the era of her disgrace and
subjugation and misfortune!</p>

<p>The stepping of the vast crowd in the square was
like the patter of a great storm, and the hum of voices
rose up like the murmur of the ocean; but in the chamber
all was so still that one could have heard the dropping of
a pin.</p>

<p>Under the balcony of this room were seated in pomp
and state the Papal commissioners, radiant in gold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
scarlet respectability; and Pilate and Herod, on terms of
the most excellent friendship, were ready to act over again
the part they had acted fourteen hundred years before.
Now has arrived the moment when the three followers of
the Man of Calvary are to be degraded from the fellowship
of His visible Church.</p>

<p>Father Antonio, Agostino, and Baccio stood forth in
the balcony, and, drawing in their breath, looked down, as
the three men of the hour, pale and haggard with imprisonment
and torture, were brought up amid the hoots and
obscene jests of the populace. Savonarola first was led
before the tribunal, and there, with circumstantial minuteness,
endued with all his priestly vestments, which again,
with separate ceremonies of reprobation and ignominy, were
taken from him. He stood through it all serene as stood
his Master when stripped of His garments on Calvary.
There is a momentary hush of voices and drawing in of
breaths in the great crowd. The Papal legate takes him
by the hand and pronounces the words, "Jerome Savonarola,
I separate thee from the Church Militant and the
Church Triumphant."</p>

<p>He is going to speak.</p>

<p>"What says he?" said Agostino, leaning over the balcony.</p>

<p>Solemnly and clear that impressive voice which so often
had thrilled the crowds in that very square made <span class="locked">answer,&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"From the Church Militant you <i>may</i> divide me; but
from the Church Triumphant, <i>no</i>,&mdash;<i>that</i> is above your
power!"&mdash;and a light flashed out in his face as if a smile
from Christ had shone down upon him.</p>

<p>"Amen!" said Father Antonio; "he hath witnessed a
good confession,"&mdash;and turning, he went in, and, burying
his face in his hands, remained in prayer.</p>

<p>When like ceremonies had been passed through with
the others, the three martyrs were delivered to the secular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
executioner, and, amid the scoffs and jeers of the brutal
crowd, turned their faces to the gibbet.</p>

<p>"Brothers, let us sing the Te Deum," said Savonarola.</p>

<p>"Do not so infuriate the mob," said the executioner,
"for harm might be done."</p>

<p>"At least let us repeat it together," said he, "lest we
forget it."</p>

<p>And so they went forward, speaking to each other of the
glorious company of the apostles, the goodly fellowship of
the prophets, the noble army of martyrs, and giving thanks
aloud in that great triumphal hymn of the Church of all
Ages.</p>

<p>When the lurid fires were lighted which blazed red and
fearful through that crowded square, all in that silent
chamber fell on their knees, and Father Antonio repeated
prayers for departing souls.</p>

<p>To the last, that benignant right hand which had so
often pointed the way of life to that faithless city was
stretched out over the crowd in the attitude of blessing;
and so loving, not hating, praying with exaltation, and
rendering blessing for cursing, the souls of the martyrs
ascended to the great cloud of witnesses above.</p>

<h2 class="vspace2"><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII</a><br />

<span class="smaller">CONCLUSION</span></h2>

<p>A few days after the death of Savonarola, Father Antonio
was found one morning engaged in deep converse
with Agnes.</p>

<p>The Princess Paulina, acting for her family, desired to
give her hand to the Prince Agostino Sarelli, and the interview
related to the religious scruples which still conflicted
with the natural desires of the child.</p>

<p>"Tell me, my little one," said Father Antonio, "frankly
and truly, dost thou not love this man with all thy heart?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my father, I do," said Agnes; "but ought I not
to resign this love for the love of my Saviour?"</p>

<p>"I see not why," said the monk. "Marriage is a sacrament
as well as holy orders, and it is a most holy and venerable
one, representing the divine mystery by which the
souls of the blessed are united to the Lord. I do not hold
with Saint Bernard, who, in his zeal for a conventual life,
seemed to see no other way of serving God but for all men
and women to become monks and nuns. The holy order
is indeed blessed to those souls whose call to it is clear and
evident, like mine; but if there be a strong and virtuous
love for a worthy object, it is a vocation unto marriage,
which should not be denied."</p>

<p>"So, Agnes," said the knight, who had stolen into the
room unperceived, and who now boldly possessed himself
of one of her hands "Father Antonio hath decided this
matter," he added, turning to the Princess and Elsie, who
entered, "and everything having been made ready for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
journey into France, the wedding ceremony shall take place
on the morrow, and, for that we are in deep affliction, it
shall be as private as may be."</p>

<p>And so on the next morning the wedding ceremony took
place, and the bride and groom went on their way to
France, where preparations befitting their rank awaited
them.</p>

<p>Old Elsie was heard to observe to Monica, that there
was some sense in making pilgrimages, since this to Rome,
which she had undertaken so unwillingly, had turned out
so satisfactory.</p>

<p>In the reign of Julius II., the banished families who
had been plundered by the Borgias were restored to their
rights and honors at Rome; and there was a princess of
the house of Sarelli then at Rome, whose sanctity of life
and manners was held to go back to the traditions of primitive
Christianity, so that she was renowned not less for
goodness than for rank and beauty.</p>

<p>In those days, too, Raphael, the friend of Fra Bartolommeo,
placed in one of the grandest halls of the Vatican,
among the Apostles and Saints, the image of the traduced
and despised martyr whose ashes had been cast to the winds
and waters in Florence. His memory lingered long in
Italy, so that it was even claimed that miracles were
wrought in his name and by his intercession. Certain it
is, that the living words he spoke were seeds of immortal
flowers which blossomed in secret dells and obscure shadows
of his beautiful Italy.</p>
